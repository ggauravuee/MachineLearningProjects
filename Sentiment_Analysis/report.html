/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>While this outing certainly doesn&#39;t live up to its predecessor, it does have more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after laying waste to a city block with his &#34;Videodisc Cannon,&#34; we see a close up of Nimoy&#39;s face. As a single tear sheds from his left eye, we know at that point that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can&#39;t help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade. Absolute brilliance!!! The sex scenes display a nice balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Afterwards, I felt I had a pretty good understanding of how to work the Magnavision Videodisc Player. Too bad they haven&#39;t produced them in over 25 years.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It also converts words to the lower case and removes the punctuations (in addition to tokenizing it i.e. creates comma separated list or bag of words)</p>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The training and test both dataset should be in same format for a machine learning model. That's why one need to apply the same data preparation steps to both train and test data. In this case, one should apply the <code>preprocess_data</code> and <code>convert_and_pad_data</code> methods to pre-process the data so that both are in same data format.</p>

<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>

<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script.

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<p>Supposing we have the training method above, we will test that it is working by writing a bit of code in the notebook that executes our training method on the small sample training set that we loaded earlier. The reason for doing this in the notebook is so that we have an opportunity to fix any errors that arise early when they are easier to diagnose.</p>

<p>In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run. When the training container is executed it will check the uploaded directory (if there is one) for a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install any required Python libraries, after which the training script will be run.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Training-the-model">(TODO) Training the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Training-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>When a PyTorch model is constructed in SageMaker, an entry point must be specified. This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Here both XGBoost and RNN models have comparable performance. In general, RNN/LSTM model should be more suitable for sentiment analysis because they have the ability to understand the order of features i.e they can remember previous inputs. So, we can improve the accuracy of it by doing Hyper-parameter tuning etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generally the tree based models like XGBoost, the features are usually count matrix or tf-idf matrix, which doesn't take the order of words into account.</p>

<p>The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?</p>
<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>

<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

b&#39;This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there\&#39;s no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. I give this a 55/100. Most folks will want to &#34;steer&#34; clear.&#39;

b&#39;Sensitive, extremely quiet paced love story between a married journalist and his young and atractive neighbor, she too also married. They lived their love for a time but the obstacles and the fear of hurting their families and children invites to a separation. A reflexive look on delicate question like love, friendship, honor and loneliness, always present in human lives, whether you are an American or a Chinese. I give this a 7 (seven)&#39;

b&#39;Pistol-packing Pam Grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in &#34;Asylum of Satan&#34; director William Girdler\&#39;s entertaining blaxploitation actioneer &#34;Sheba Baby,&#34; co-starring D\&#39;Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. &#34;Sheba Baby&#34; is one of several tough chick flicks that Grier appeared in during the 1970s, including &#34;Coffy,&#34; &#34;Foxy Brown,&#34; and &#34;Friday Foster.&#34; The short-lived Girdler co-wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer David Shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business. Unfortunately, &#34;Sheba Baby&#34; isn\&#39;t nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that Grier made under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill helmed the African-American North Carolina native in &#34;Coffy,&#34; &#34;Foxy Brown,&#34; &#34;The Big Bird Cage,&#34; and &#34;The Big Doll House.&#34; Anybody that analyzes images of African-American women in cinema should be familiar with these epics. The chief problem with &#34;Sheba Baby&#34; is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Naturally, the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn\&#39;t hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like: &#34;Anything worth having is worth stealing.&#34; Additionally, composer Monk Huggins does provide a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason warbling it, is &#34;Good Man Is Gone.&#34; &#34;Sheba Baby&#34; casts Grier as stylist Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves the Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help out her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that her father, Andy (Rudy Challenger of &#34;Detroit 9000&#34;), is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (cigar-chomping D\&#39;Urville Martin of &#34;Hammer&#34;) who demands that Andy sell out his loan company to Pilot or die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, Pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash Andy\&#39;s office, but our heroine\&#39;s father catches them in the act. They turn Sheba\&#39;s father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fight scene, Girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh. Earlier, Andy\&#39;s right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of &#34;Horror High&#34;), had sent Sheba a telegram requesting that she return to Louisville, but she didn\&#39;t receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn\&#39;t know where to find her. Brick and Sheba hook up, rekindle their romantic flames, and share a night in the sack. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former Louisville, Kentucky, police woman, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. After she arrives home, Sheba borrows her father\&#39;s car and barely escapes being blown to bits. As she is walking out the door to get into her father\&#39;s car, Andy receives another harassing call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum. A gratified Pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse. In other words, cranking up the car won\&#39;t trigger the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick rescue Sheba before the car blows up. Earlier, Sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference. &#34;Dad, I know you think I\&#39;m doing a man\&#39;s job, but I\&#39;m not going to sit on the sidelines just because I\&#39;m a woman,&#34; Sheba tells him. After her near-death experience, Sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her father\&#39;s car. She grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba has ground the guy\&#39;s face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a pay-off at the town\&#39;s railroad museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered Pilot getting away by the skin of his chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, Pilot sends a quintet of out-of-town contract thugs armed-to-the-teeth to trash Andy\&#39;s office. These gunsels ignore their no-kill orders. Not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons, but they also blast Sheba\&#39;s dad with a shotgun. Sheba retaliates in short order. Wielding her nickel-plated revolver, she guns down three of the four assailants Dirty Harry style. The last hit-man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when Homicide Detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of &#34;Abby&#34;) and a uniform cop arrive on the scene. At the hospital, Andy Shayne dies holding his daughter\&#39;s hand. Naturally, Pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy. Afterward, Sheba tracks down a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of &#34;Cleopatra Jones&#34;), and pries information out of him about the Pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. This is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming. Walker warns Pilot about Sheba. Pilot and his henchmen confront Sheba in a parking lot and swap lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police corner one of Pilot\&#39;s men, she deals with the others. Pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and Sheba runs him down. She pins Pilot to a roller-coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller-coaster cuts his head off. Pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to Sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of &#34;The Hellcats&#34;), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as &#34;the guy with all the right answers.&#34; &#34;Sheba Baby&#34; isn\&#39;t top-notch Pam Grier. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick.&#39;

b&#39;El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really kicking ass. This film with its great cast - Damian Chapa ( Blood in Blood Out ), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many more ) - is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE. A Film that everyone MUST SEE. 2 hours full of action with fantastic unbelievable stunt !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We are eagerly waiting for part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one ? Keep up the good work !!! I loved it !!&#39;

b&#39;Certainly this film has the ring of truth about it, as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a Marine base. It deals with the attempted cover-up by the local Marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a Marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend, a Marine captain. The man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. He continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. Finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. The major, you see, was a decorated hero from Vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the Marine base. The captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely. The director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. You\&#39;re lucky if you know where you\&#39;re at most of the time. Bear with them, though; it\&#39;s a worthwhile story as the captain\&#39;s court martial trial unfolds, and it seems every man\&#39;s hand is against her, even her attorney at times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? Well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you\&#39;ll have to see for yourself. There is a kind of &#34;pacifist&#34; message folded into the film, but forget about that. Sure, &#34;war is hell&#34;, but sometimes it can\&#39;t be avoided. We\&#39;ll need those Marines then, even if they aren\&#39;t always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem &#34;Tommy Atkins&#34;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;It\&#39;s Tommy this and Tommy that, And Tommy wait outside. But, it\&#39;s room for Mr. Atkins, When the troopship\&#39;s on the tide.&#34;&#39;

b&#34;this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he doesn&#39;t love her back and he&#39;s a mean son of a bitch. he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away. its weird yeah!! but different than other movies in a good way i think. i don&#39;t know what to compare it to but its a love story. but has lots of funny stuff too. like get to see James Franco in a wig. i liked the Notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story. but the rest is way different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion. i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don&#39;t know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see it!!!!&#34;

b&#39;Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film \xc3\x90 buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70\xc3\x95s fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the Titanic\xc3\x95s sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style that\xc3\x95s a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong. This is one to watch over and over again\xc3\x89after you put the kids to bed.&#39;

b&#39;After three outstanding BBC television series\&#39; and a Christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (yet perversely lovable) characters of bleak fictional town Royston Vasey make the jump to celluloid, along with their creators - The League of Gentlemen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more familiar three-quarters of the foursome, with the central roles shared between the trio. In an added twist, the final member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - horror of horrors - he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy at The League\&#39;s decision to kill off the Vasey inhabitants. &#34;You\&#39;re not real!&#34; screams Dyson in vain, as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge. Mayhem ensues, as reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confused? You will be, as the camp, innuendo-ridden Teutonic, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take on the daily guise of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by cannibalistic butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With shades of an even more demented Misery, Briss attempts to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The erstwhile comedian becomes embroiled in The League\&#39;s latest, post-Vasey adventure - The King\&#39;s Evil - entering a typically twisted 17th century England, complete with cameos from Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (due to his select line of clothing), Geoff saves the day and is treated as a hero, but for the denouement of the film, he joins characters old and new at the Church of Royston Vasey to meet with their makers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of the series, the film is a must-see. And yes, it does feature Papa Lazarou (albeit a little too fleetingly). Pen-loving Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and cursed vet Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favourites on show, and The League\&#39;s portrayal of themselves (plus Sheen\&#39;s as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The League of Gentlemen are the Radiohead of British comedy - they are ambitious, groundbreaking (witness the excellent Series Three) and not happy to rest on their laurels. They also divide opinion accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, their macabre sense of humour is not for every palate, and while not written exclusively for \&#39;fans\&#39;, a grasp of the storyline would benefit those who have previously viewed the series. Nevertheless, Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League will no doubt manage to attract a new breed of fan, as well as appeasing and pleasing existing ones.&#39;

b&#34;This film works on a lot of different levels. It&#39;s a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I&#39;ve seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch it I&#39;m not sure who to go call first--my parents, my wife, a friend I&#39;ve lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue. Expect a lot of laughs, and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord. I&#39;m pretty sure they will.&#34;

b&#34;Great movie. I thought it would never be as good as it was. Great special effects, great story, big laughs. It didn&#39;t take itself seriously, which is why I think it worked so well. Even the acting was surprisingly good. Overall a very funny and sometimes chilling story.&#34;

b&#39;Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill &amp; Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother\&#39;s house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill\&#39;s life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso Edward Van Halen throughout the movie, also features cameos by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also makes an appearance! Classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. Now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated DVD release! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at &#34;The Last American Virgin&#34; which is similar to &#34;Wild Life&#34;. I rate both highly.&#39;

b&#39;My family and I enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own father spent some time in Changi before going onto the Thailand-Burma Railway in &#34;F&#34; Force. Much as been said about the treatment the POW\&#39;s received, I will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No show could truly convey what the POW\&#39;s went through, but this comes closer than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Ex POW\&#39;s say, &#34;If you didn\&#39;t have mates you didn\&#39;t survive.&#34; This show succeeds in getting this message across.&#39;

b&#39;I must admit that I didn\&#39;t get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn\&#39;t help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Return to Me&#34; has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!) The charming story is beautifully woven with clever comedy and brought to life with superb performances by veteran as well as younger actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who say that David Duchovny hasn\&#39;t really had a good shot at breaking out of his &#34;Fox Mulder&#34; mold, I agree. I\&#39;ve seen his other film work, and is, by far, the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny, and lively in her role as Grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of these two leads, however, you are surrounded by Grace\&#39;s close-knit family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute stitch, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real-life force. I cannot, however, go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggia, and the dearly departed Carroll O\&#39;Connor. Ironically, I watched this film again on DVD only the day before he passed away. This was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his calibre could certainly be proud to leave as the finale to a great career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#34;Return To Me&#34; turned what would have still been just a fun love story, and grew it into a film that has become one of my favorites! Take the time rent this one.....it\&#39;s well worth the effort!&#39;

b&#39;I was born in Beijing, China and moved to the United States at the age of 9. Been home to Beijing several times since and loved it each time. One of the many things I love about Beijing is the people and the ambiance they bring to the city. &#34;You hau hao hao shuo&#34; (which translate more accurately to &#34;if you have something to say, say it nicely&#34;) delightfully and truthfully captures that feeling of Beijing. I suppose you would have to have lived in and kinda understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, though you might enjoy it regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The story is not complicated, intentionally kinda quirky, and captivating. I will leave it to unfold by itself and not tell you too much except some comments. Each detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets, and restaurants feels like home. (Zhang Yimou most likely shot everything &#34;on location&#34;) But more importantly, the characters - our &#34;hero&#34;, the girl, the kind-hearted but unfortunate &#34;laptop man&#34;, and the night club owner are each native to Beijing and lovable in their distinct ways. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mostly driven by situations and conversation (save the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I am 21 now. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed by Zhang Yimou\&#39;s ability to transform ordinary people into believable screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;keep cool&#34; - different. hilarious. meaningful.&#39;

b&#39;I saw this at the screening at GenCon in Indy. I had some time to kill and decided to check it out. It played to about 1000 people in a packed standing-room-only ballroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a ride! The script was tight. The action tense. The pacing perfect. The character exposition excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn\&#39;t a big budget film. Yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s true that this film was targeted at a certain audience - gamers/tabletop players - the creators make no effort to hide that. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. For in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if Mom who happens to be watching will &#34;get it&#34;, they got the biggest laughs time and time again. But there\&#39;s enough universality there that Mom will be laughing too, even if she\&#39;s not in on every joke. I think too many times I see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people, but the movie just ends up suffering for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not this flick. Indeed, this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it\&#39;s finger from the opening credits. And, while the viewers around me *really* wanted to like the film, they weren\&#39;t pushovers - gamers can be among the most critical niche out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m so glad I got to see this in a big crowd. At least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film. How often does that happen at screenings? It should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my own part, I can\&#39;t wait for this to be released. After it ended, one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous TV/DVD release. That date cannot come soon enough.&#39;

b&#34;Wow, I loved this movie, this film was filled with plot twists, good acting, great story, and a surprising ending. To be completely honest this movie wasn&#39;t overly gory, it does contain some gore, though, but was more on the psychological side. I read it on the Internet: the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days. Amazing!!! This is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making. What starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted, even a bit more sinister. Not much I can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations&#34;
b&#39;1.0&#39;
b&#39;Is this a good movie? It\&#39;s hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when &#34;the old gentleman&#34; meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact. Not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But working on what must have been a very low budget, one of the greatest production designers -- and the person for whom the term &#34;production designer&#34; was invented -- creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling. At times, of course, the movie is very silly, but it has its moments.&#39;

b&#34;Although this small film kind of got lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly hold its own with that star studded classic. It&#39;s another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran in On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really small time corruption. But he&#39;s real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks who intimidates the other workers by being handy with his fists and the bailing hook and he gets the rest to kickback part of their hard earned money. And it&#39;s all hard earned money in that job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One guy Warden can&#39;t intimidate is Sidney Poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite the friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even fix Cassavetes up with Kathleen Maguire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warden is truly one loathsome creature and it&#39;s sad how by sheer force of personality and physical prowess he cows almost everyone else into submission. In that sense he&#39;s tougher than Lee J. Cobb who did have to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will in On The Waterfront.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edge Of The City marked the big screen directorial debut of Martin Ritt who did a great job with a good cast of New York based players and spot on location cinematography. The film&#39;s low budget does show, but you&#39;re so impressed with the ensemble cast you don&#39;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough Poitier are both fine, but my personal favorite in this film is Ruby Dee. She should have gotten some award for her performance, her final scene with Cassavetes is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catch this one if ever possible. I wish it were out on DVD or VHS.&#34;

Girls, this is one football film you will need to see, its hilarious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing, the guys may not be well known actors, but this is good down to earth real humour, with real people, and I for one applaud them for taking this to the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL DONE!&#39;

b&#34;If you love the book, as I do, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and I&#39;ve enjoyed it many times. After that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book, i.e., how Jean creates a town like Alice (Springs). In the early part, the major change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. This rather skews this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious, such as: in the book, he intimates to Joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia, but in the video he gives Joe no clue about Jean&#39;s whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. I see no reason why they threw in a fight between Joe and Jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an Aussie dig at Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they bring on Strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. These abominations take up time in the last hour, which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can both be happy.&#34;

b&#39;007\&#39;s Goldeneye is one of the best N64 releases ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than this game? Well...Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are far better and superior games. But I still love Goldeneye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best adaptation from a movie second only to Star Wars adaptations. The story is perfect. It\&#39;s like you are in the movie itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The enemies\&#39; artificial intelligence are the best part in this game. I loved playing the stage in which James and Natalya break from the Janus base as the Goldeneye prepares to burn it. Escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult. Eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s also the toughest game I\&#39;ve ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the one exception. I\&#39;m still trying to beat the 00 Agent difficult level, but winning the easier levels was already a great victory. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked: &#34;For England James?&#34;. I answered: &#34;No, for ME!&#34; It happened just in the moment I blasted him to death. Just like in the movie. I love accomplishing every objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multiplayer gaming is even better. At first I got killed every holy second. Now, I know how to win. I love forcing my playmates by playing at License to Kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music and sound are astounding. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to this. The only thing I still wanted to hear was the Goldeneye theme song, that plays at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Zelda was released, I nearly forgot I still had this game. It\&#39;s still excellent, even if it\&#39;s already surpassed. I hope other 007 games are produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic job Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game on the N64 exclusively. Magnificent job Nintendo!&#39;

b&#39;(This has been edited for space)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chan-wook Park\&#39;s new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It\&#39;s a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola\&#39;s &#34;Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se Raquin&#34;. It\&#39;s an odd mix that doesn\&#39;t always gel, but none the less has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled. Its not so much what happens is bothersome, its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies, but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire, and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. From there it all goes sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ever changing film, this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. It\&#39;s a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has enough going on that one could, and people probably will, write books discussing the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the &#34;affliction&#34; that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It\&#39;s contrasted with what happens later, it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn\&#39;t going to work. Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather its something else. I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled. Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done, but it\&#39;s the other stuff, the looks, the talk, the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. I love the looks, the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act, the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected, and the mad passion of possible consummation. This is one of the great screen romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). If you\&#39;ve ever loved deeply I\&#39;m guessing you\&#39;ll find some part of your hear on screen, I know I did. The statement &#34;I just wanted to spend eternity with you&#34; has a sad poignancy to it. It\&#39;s both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. Its not, as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesn\&#39;t always come together. The various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. Frequently I was wondering where the film was going. I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the film a great deal. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it, and I\&#39;m guessing that it will do so for several days more. Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year.&#39;

b&#34;I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it has a heart as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful, a piece of art come alive. So it was a diesel engine sub, so what? I learned that the Aircraft Carrier USS Ranger (which stood in for The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was &#39;conventionally powered&#39;, which might mean that Ranger was a diesel too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this can&#39;s been on the stingray since Korea! This can expired in 1966! Buckman: (Takes finger full and tastes it) What&#39;s the matter, sir? It still tastes like creamed corn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pascal: (Yelling) Except, it&#39;s DEVILED HAM!! Buckman: That would be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s story, perhaps a wee strained, seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge, and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered but still seaworthy Balao-class sub, and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear Navy and &#39;attack&#39; Charlston Harbor, and Norfolk. 2-star Admiral Graham (with his eye on his third star, and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the ragtag crew, hoping that they would screw up so Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team, and can he take an old, out of date sub, and beat the Navy&#39;s best?&#34;

b&#34;This is one of the classic TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, where with the simplest of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable. Five figures are inside a container/prison: a Major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. They are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What have they in common? None can figure it out. But gradually the Major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other&#39;s shoulders. And the Major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... I&#39;ll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello&#39;s famous play. Whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: Pirandello&#39;s characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. But the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations. This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors, William Windon as the Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite effective.&#34;

b&#39;First at all: If you like watching movies I recommend you NOT to watch this one. Why? Afterwards you won\&#39;t appreciate any other movie so easily anymore...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I don\&#39;t wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect, intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing, like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography \xc2\x96 in \xc2\x84Angels of the Universe&#34; there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is just great, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur R\xc3\xb3s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this story about Pall, a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. What is more, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other comments was already referring to another point: This movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. Despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and most of all sad. It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness, rage and solitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: When you\&#39;ve seen the movie \xc2\x96 watch it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the \xc2\x84moral of the story&#34;. And of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better.&#39;

b&#39;In short if you want to watch Burt Reynolds best films than this one must be included. If you don\&#39;t like Burt you may still like this. If you love Burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time! Being from Atlanta it does hit home but it\&#39;s also nice to see a cop/action/drama that takes place somewhere other than NY City, Chicago, Miami, or LA. The film is funny at points with &amp; good plot &amp; good performances from a great supporting cast (every character is real &amp; the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out)A nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half &amp; it has some good old fashion shootouts &amp; fistfights (no CGI thank God REAL ACTION!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Clint Eastwood did his best impression of a Burt Reynolds movie with &#34;Every Which Way But Loose&#34; &amp; &#34;Any Which Way You Can&#34; then Burt responded with his best Clint type flick with this, &amp; it comes off great!&#39;

b&#34;I have seen this play many times, from Olivier to Branagh, and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory. Many actors have captured aspects of this character, but for me, it is always Derek Jacobi&#39;s performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short.&#34;

b&#34;Flatliners has all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher film - intelligent, youthful characters, stunning cinematography, a gripping story, and excellent performances. It&#39;s escapist fun but it&#39;s done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving precedings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors, and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things (see the cast list). Their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his egotistical med-student role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love about Schumacher; his use of light and location create images that stick. A disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed - reminded me of The Lost Boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a film that takes an awesome premise - curious students want to find out what&#39;s after death, and successfully follows it through into a scary, gripping tale of redemption. One of Schumacher&#39;s best; highly recommended.&#34;

b&#39;This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. &#34;subversives&#34; (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted &#34;criminals&#34; are offered three days in &#34;Punishment Park&#34;. Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film from Peter Watkins even pre-dates &#34;Battle Royale&#34; and &#34;Series 7&#34;, though its angle of attack is more blatantly political. Shot in \&#39;71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is razer sharp. The narrative cuts back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like trials that convicted them. Today, this film still retains its power. In \&#39;71, there was nothing but nothing quite like it. This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. It has the balls that most people today have lost.&#39;

b&#39;I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an unexceptable sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then. Cause seriously I think it should have had a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of Caddyshack even though the film rating on first one was (R) and the second one was (PG) it was still lots of fun .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(7/10)&#39;

b&#39;Set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it\&#39;s a story of madness. The landscape may be quite picturesque, but there\&#39;s madness herein, concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person kills little children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In style and tone this film resembles Dario Argento\&#39;s famous Italian giallos, those fascinating whodunit horror films, except that Argento\&#39;s films are much better looking. Still, the visuals in Fulci\&#39;s &#34;Don\&#39;t Torture A Duckling&#34; are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the &#34;ducklings&#34; is vulnerably alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. But this is no slasher film. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn\&#39;t assume an agenda on the part of the director. Don\&#39;t dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the end provides good misdirection. However, in one scene midway through, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The film\&#39;s finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer\&#39;s mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t care for the film\&#39;s widescreen projection. But background music is effective, and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to low-key jazz, to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average, though in a couple of cases, it\&#39;s a bit overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not as visually brilliant as Argento\&#39;s giallos, &#34;Don\&#39;t Torture A Duckling&#34; nevertheless is a fine film, one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.&#39;

b&#34;I can&#39;t help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others&#39; comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is certainly worth your looking at.&#34;

b&#34;Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances \xc2\x96 though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains \xc2\x96 you&#39;ll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one \xc2\x96 both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink of choice with this one. A lap rug and a cat would be optional.&#34;

b&#39;Danny Boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers. That honour belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley\&#39;s Comet running amok in London end-of-the-world movie ever made. Tobe Hooper may have made a lot of crap, but for this deliriously demented epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. Plus it offers space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to come out of France since Simone Simon, spending the entire movie naked. Which she does very, very well. Just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on Earth has ever encountered, she\&#39;s also &#34;totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous.&#34; It\&#39;s a pitch meeting I\&#39;d have loved to have sat in on: Astronauts from the British space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150-mile long artichoke/umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of Halley\&#39;s Comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to Earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of London of their lifeforce amid much nudity, whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue (&#34;I\&#39;ve been in space for six months, and she looks perfect to me.&#34; &#34;Assume we know nothing, which is understating the matter.&#34; &#34;Don\&#39;t worry, a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex.&#34;). Oh, and we\&#39;ll get the writers of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of Mark of the Devil, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. Sounds like a winner, here\&#39;s $22m \xc2\x96 have fun. And they do, they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, there\&#39;s enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexually transmitted \&#39;plague\&#39; offers ample opportunity for allegory), but in the hands of the Go-Go boys at Cannon, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns instead to be more Plan 10 From Outer Space. It\&#39;s full-to-bursting with delirious inanity, be it Frank Finlay\&#39;s hilarious death scene (&#34;Here I go!&#34;), Peter Firth\&#39;s grand entrance (&#34;I\&#39;m Colonel Caine.&#34; &#34;From the SAS?&#34; discreetly shouts Michael Gothard across a room full of reporters: &#34;Gentlemen, that last remark was not for publication. This is a D-Notice situation&#34; he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen), the security guards offering Mathilda May\&#39;s naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping, reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people, the sweaty Prime Minister sucking the life out of his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since Mrs Gorgo lost junior at Battersea Funfair and went on the rampage. And that\&#39;s not mentioning the &#34;This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!&#34; scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire\&#39;s &#34;It\&#39;ll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me&#34; line while a lead-stake wielding Peter Firth adopts his best Action Man voice to reply &#34;I\&#39;ll do just that!&#34; In one scene alone you have a possessed Patrick Stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero\&#39;s mind, Steve &#34;I-never-got-over-playing-Charlie-Manson&#34; Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full-on &#34;Helta-Skelta!&#34; mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones look restrained) playing the Home Secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a Doctor Who around the time no-one was watching it anymore) hamming up the blas\xc3\xa9 public school macho in the hope that no-one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of John Hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid-psychic-tornado to bring in more drugs. As if they needed any more in this film. It\&#39;s just a shame that Frank Finlay\&#39;s mad-haired scientist who isn\&#39;t qualified to certify death on alien life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski) missed out on the action in that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how mad you think the film is, it still manages to get madder still, whether it be a zombie pathologist (&#34;He too needs feeding&#34;) exploding all over the Home secretary\&#39;s suit, Patrick Stewart\&#39;s blood and entrails forming a naked Mathilda May or the space vampires turning St Paul\&#39;s Cathedral into the world\&#39;s biggest laser-show to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship. I loved every gloriously insane moment. In it\&#39;s own truly unique way, this might be the greatest film ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the UK rather than the heavily edited 101-minute US version, which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar, but also fully restores Henry Mancini\&#39;s score to its original glory (the US version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, Mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic Universal sci-fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb, with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from Blake Edwards. Sadly there\&#39;s no more than a trailer by way of extras, though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from Hooper\&#39;s originally intended 128-minute cut: from what\&#39;s on display here, these might just offer even more comedy gold!&#39;

b&#39;I won\&#39;t go to a generalization, and say it\&#39;s the best love story of all time, as some have said. That\&#39;s fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don\&#39;t want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too \&#39;broad\&#39; for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awards say it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn\&#39;t agree more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-Oscars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;41-wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, &#34;Elaine, I simply can\&#39;t take my eyes off of it!&#34; In this instance, I don\&#39;t agree with Elaine\&#39;s response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it\&#39;s case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in &#34;Sabrina&#34; Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I\&#39;m truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)&#39;

b&#34;After the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that Holness and Adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi. Yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show (on the good episodes) as darkplace. i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are&#39;nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it. if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as Dean Learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have&#39;nt seen much Dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie. His argument with Def Lepord over their name. All in All a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes.&#34;

b&#39;This film has &#34;haunted&#34; me since I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn\&#39;t know what it was called so am so pleased to have tracked it down finally. I remember being quite scared, because I\&#39;d just been to a tin mine in Cornwall when I watched it, so could imagine it all. Fortunately I didn\&#39;t see any ghosts of dead children there, but I found this film really quite disturbing and scary when I was much younger. I\&#39;ve certainly never forgotten it, even though I couldn\&#39;t find it anywhere. I seem to remember The Children\&#39;s Film Foundation films being generally good, but they don\&#39;t show them at all any more. I also remember programmes like The Children Of Green Knowe in the same era on BBC - equally unsettling in its own way.&#39;

b&#34;Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I&#39;ve only recently gotten acquainted with (I need to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to fully grasp them), but in watching Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, supposedly based on a saying in Buddhism) I realized I was watching as skillful and absorbing a crime film as I had seen in a quite some time. Though his film has dialog, it is mainly to keep the film&#39;s scenes rolling along, adherent to the plot. What kept me on the alert, even in seemingly mundane scenes/sequences, was the emphasis on the characters&#39; movements, or behavior patterns. Melville has his story laid out, and he is careful to take his time to tell it (this could seem boring to some, but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters/environments over plot). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, scheming a new heist), Gian Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping &amp; on the lam from hand-cuffed custody, meets Corey by luck), Yves Montand as Jansen (an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons, a friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced investigator, who is on the look-out for Vogel, and on his toes with internal affairs). Each of these actors plays their parts with precision, detachment, and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops. The heist sequence gives little hints, for example, like how Vogel cops-a-feel off a female statue while passing down the halls, or how Jansen takes out a flask and merely has a whiff of the contents (and what a dream this guy creates). Even Corey&#39;s movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As absorbing and cool the story becomes, and as great the skills were to make it happen (via cinematographer Henri Decae, the editing, and the musical score by Eric Demarsan), it&#39;s the people on the screen that gain fascination, in how they stay true to their natures and ideals. Not a film to be missed by French new-wave enthusiasts, and modern-day crime movie buffs might want to take the 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of Melville&#39;s work. A suave piece of film-making that still ranks as one of my all-time favorites.&#34;

b&#34;Not since J. Michael Straczynski&#39;s Babylon 5, has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show. This is easily the best thing on TV right now! The characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well-being. The villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they&#39;re up to next. And Brian Hensen&#39;s puppet work is the most innovative out there. Kudos to Rockne S. O&#39;Bannon for a job well done!&#34;

b&#39;A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character &#34;Alice&#34; played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library. I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I high anticipate in seeing more from her performances.&#39;

b&#39;Kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays, this used to be required watching when i was in high school. It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone. But also it turns the camera\&#39;s POV into that of tourist, passing through this alien world. The band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn\&#39;t exist anymore. Then again, it\&#39;s not as easy to come by $16/month former-church closets like Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard of bands do you know that aren\&#39;t trying like the dickens to get a record deal? These guys just didn\&#39;t care. And who can\&#39;t love the commentary of the little French dude who used to be the &#34;singer&#34; for Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film: &#34;I have excellent news for the world ... there\&#39;s no such thing as New Wave.&#34; Whew! What a relief!&#39;

b&#39;I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say &#34;french culture&#34;. I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy\&#39;s brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My french isn\&#39;t that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH IT!&#39;

b&#39;This story of the troubles caused by an over-possessive, overpowering, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons, and their girls, is a strong vehicle for stellar performances by Irene Dunn (the new daughter-in-law), Joel McCrea (the number-one son), Eric Linden (the number-two son) and Frances Dee (fiance of number-two son). Here\&#39;s the show of the pure tyranny of mother\&#39;s jealousy and possessiveness run amok as four good people find their owns lives damaged, their plans changed and their own identities in jeopardy. Irene Dunn is stellar in her role. Joel McCrea\&#39;s performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet this reviewer finds Frances Dee\&#39;s performance the best of all. Hers is the first character in the story to show the strength of her inner feelings. Her portrayal in her heartbreak broken-engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee yanks the viewer around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face ! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been too long overlooked, and is now almost forgotten as the magnificent actress that she was. No actress who started in film after WWII has had anything to speak of on Frances Dee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, which was never released for TV, you\&#39;ll find this &#34;old fashioned drawing-room drama&#34; to be an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after its 1933 release because it is filled with superb performances.&#39;

b&#39;I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself &#34;where I have I seen them before?&#34; Forget the running time listed on New Line\&#39;s tape, this ain\&#39;t no 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB.

b&#34;Recap: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American Congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in USA&#39;s covert war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: A rather funny movie about not so funny things, especially since they were real. But focusing on the movie, Hanks performs very well as a mischievous womanizing Congressman with a good heart that becomes the champion for the covert war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the entire movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman especially, has a rather humorous tone. So much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But, the story that it tell, and maybe the ending the most, are serious indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story of what happened with some questions about what might have been. So the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want that. Something for everybody? 7/10&#34;

b&#34;I really liked this movie. If other people want to give it an average around 5.0/10 that&#39;s their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland&#39;s performance as a private eye is totally awesome. The story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story might not be perfect but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that. Moreover, the ending is incredibly cool and their the jig-saw puzzle really comes back to together. So anyway I liked it. I also thought the female lead actress performed very well. I&#39;m not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good, also because it doesn&#39;t give a damn about conventions of the supernatural.&#34;

b&#39;I have some great memories watching &#34;Robin of Sherwood&#34; on TV as a kid (but I think I only saw Michael Praed\xc2\xb4s episodes, by some reason). And recently my brother bought the new released DVD-boxes of the complete series. It was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV-series. The cast is great, and the locations mixed with Clannad\xc2\xb4s music adds this very special feeling. I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie is terrific in their roles as Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It\xc2\xb4s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and I\xc2\xb4ve also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally have married Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley (Praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. As have been mentioned before; if the producers of &#34;Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves&#34; would have been smart, they would have got the cast from &#34;Robin of Sherwood&#34;, and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in Sean Connery\xc2\xb4s &#34;Robin and Marian&#34;. Who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!&#39;

b&#39;I have read reviews of this film that found it \&#39;disappointing\&#39; and \&#39;confused\&#39;. I am at a loss to understand why this should be so. From the beginning I found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler: The opening titles overlay a beautiful visual of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and sweeping style. The film isn\&#39;t about the process itself though, it concerns Charles Darwin\&#39;s struggle with his conscience, his love for his wife, his deceased daughter and his search for truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appearances of his daughter are the manifestations of a tormented mind that knows it has &#34;killed God&#34;. The daughter is an adult, making adult comments about his work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he in some way responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give truly wonderful performances as Charles and Emma Darwin, as does Martha West as Annie. Bettany\&#39;s size and awkward gait give Darwin\&#39;s character a genuine sense of reality, whilst Connelly seems very comfortable with her English accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s easy to misunderstand the times in which this film resides. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed. Science and religion have always been awkward bedfellows and although it didn\&#39;t cost him his life, as it did with so many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier supremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Creation ten stars, because I think it\&#39;s beautiful, profound, superbly well acted and a genuine, no-extraneous-frills-required look at one of the world\&#39;s true geniuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone... see Bill Maher\&#39;s wonderful &#34;Religulous&#34;) was hidden for millennia. The truth, once it was discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain, and the realisation that we are all that we possess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful cinematic experience.&#39;

b&#34;One of master director Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s finer films this is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers something into Stewart&#39;s ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You never really know what&#39;s going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you&#39;re not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.&#34;

b&#39;Charlie Wilson (Two time Oscar-Winner:Tom Hanks) is a easy-going Congressman... Who loves to party, enjoys the company of woman and especially drinking his booze. When Charlie\&#39;s old friend and ex-girlfriend Joanne Herring (Oscar-Winner:Julia Roberts) wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, which that country certainly need of help. Charlie is shocked of what he seen, especially from all different ages are killed or hurt from this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels to fight the Russians, who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and one renegade CIA Agent by the name of Gust Avrakotos (Oscar-Winner:Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the largest covert operation in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Oscar-Winner:Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, Regarding Henry, Wolf) made an lively, entertaining sharp satire war comedy that is based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in a Oscar nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie\&#39;s loyal assistant are very good in their roles. Despite the excellent true-life premise, &#34;Charlie Wilson\&#39;s War&#34; never really catches fire and it is not as wickedly funny as you liked it to be. Director Nichols and Screenwriter:Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are well liked throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD\&#39;s only special features are the behind the scenes featurette with the cast &amp; crew and a real-life featurette with Charlie Wilson and Others. &#34;Charlie Wilson\&#39;s War&#34; is a good movie that could have been really great but it\&#39;s not. But this movie is smart enough to please for those, who enjoyed well written or well acted adult comedies. (*** 1/2 out of *****).&#39;

b&#39;In the wake of my personal research into the pending &#34;end cycle&#34; time of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as &#34;What The Bleep Do We Know?&#34; While some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level &#34;speak,&#34; &#34;The Elegant Universe&#34; breaks such barriers. The visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what\&#39;s being taught. True, pure discovery science is beautiful because there\&#39;s always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of &#34;established&#34; science.&#39;

b&#39;I saw &#34;Into Pitch Black&#34; on t.v. and so I had to see this. I must say, I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has David Twohy\&#39;s style improved since he wrote &#34;Critters 2&#34;, this film brought to my attention Vin Diesel. Sure, he was there in &#34;Into Pitch Black&#34;, but here he was ferocious, scary, and intense. I haven\&#39;t seen charisma like that since Schwarzenegger in the 80\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is simple enough, but it is the characters that make this film interesting. Then there was what happens with the female lead. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the film move along, the effects aren\&#39;t grand, but when Riddick fights the alien... it blew all of my complaints out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diesel hasn\&#39;t done a whole lot since this film that I would care about, but I am eagerly looking forward to the sequel.&#39;

b&#34;I liked House of Dracula much more than house of Frankenstein. Carradine is much more passable &amp; his acting isn&#39;t as ridiculous &amp; overboard as in HOF. The actors deliver solid enough performances. The subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in HOF. Better run than the stitched-together HOF. The hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. As well, Lon Chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. Worth watching twice. A classic universal horror with that typical 1940&#39;s, long lost flair. Especially good is the doctor&#39;s performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with Dracula&#39;s.&#34;

b&#39;There are many familiar Hitchcock elements (of previous and later films) and this time they mix to a jolly, but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment. You can tell that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero Cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. The famous climax on the Statue of Liberty seems a bit heavy-handed - judged by today\xc2\xb4s standards, but also compared to other Hitch monument finals (e.g. Blackmail, North by Northwest).&#39;

b&#39;*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON\&#39;T READ IF YOU DON\&#39;T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me &amp; my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as &#34;Napster&#34; [Seth Green, you\&#39;ll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], &amp; John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John\&#39;s daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father\&#39;s death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they\&#39;ve found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There\&#39;s an on-running joke about Seth Green\&#39;s character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as &#34;Napster&#34;. There\&#39;s even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes &#34;He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!&#34; The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton\&#39;s acting was a bit weak. He wasn\&#39;t a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you\&#39;re not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He\&#39;s perfect. Rating: **** out of *****&#39;

The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up. I rate this movie a very fair 78%.

b&#39;Being a Bills fan, I originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the Bills and the losing of four superbowls. But once I began to watch, I felt really connected. It was actually nice to see the &#34;Bills&#34; win the superbowl, and I must say, that for a TV movie it was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as the QB, and Jon Voight as the old-school Coach did a very fine job. 8 out of 10&#39;

b&#34;This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was &#39;The Wedding Singer&#39;. Whilst the &#39;Wedding Singer&#39; was portraying the pop side of the 80&#39;s, &#39;Rock Star&#39; is all about metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story doesn&#39;t get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock&#39;n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! The whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who acts like a true metal dude!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Rock Star&#39; is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;

b&#39;Chuck Jones\&#39;s \&#39;Beep Beep\&#39; (so called despite the fact that the Road Runner clearly says &#34;Meep Meep&#34;) is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor, the historically important but lacklustre \&#39;Fast and Furry-ous\&#39;. While it features several predictable quickfire gags, \&#39;Beep Beep\&#39; also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. Chief among these is a fantastic, extended chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There\&#39;s also a very funny longer gag involving some rocket-powered roller-skates. \&#39;Beep Beep\&#39; also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look more handsome than his scraggly prototype in \&#39;Fast and Furry-ous\&#39; but he also draws the audience into the cartoon more with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear of imminent pain. Although it\&#39;s a little slow to get going (too many lingering shots of blueprints hinder the pace in some of the early gags), once \&#39;Beep Beep\&#39; arrives at the mine shaft sequence it\&#39;s clear that Jones was beginning to get a real handle on these characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than \&#39;Beep Beep\&#39; but there\&#39;s a real feeling of triumph about this cartoon, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be milked out of this scenario.&#39;

b&#34;I just re-watched this thriller, one I had previously believed to be one of Hitch&#39;s lesser efforts. How wrong can you be! Maybe because I&#39;m older, or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing, but now I think it&#39;s amazing. Every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail, and that final scene on the merry-go-round is just breath-taking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.&#34;

b&#34;I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital. I consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idiots that put it down on production value don&#39;t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized. And never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (same era) was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site I have found where it get mentioned.&#34;

b&#39;Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they\&#39;re always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary &#34;Don\&#39;t Look Now&#34; depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see &#34;Just Married&#34; with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can\&#39;t say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the movie I now wish I had gotten around to reading the Thomas Mann novella it\&#39;s based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I don\&#39;t know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition, I\&#39;m left wondering about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde)\&#39;s obsession with young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. Those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it\&#39;s not particularly long, and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. The film benefits from the ravishing music of Gustave Mahler, on whom Aschenbach\&#39;s character is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a moving performance, and the movie is graced by the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of Italy\&#39;s great beauties, as Tadzio\&#39;s mother.&#39;

b&#39;Ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for &#34;ABC Afterschool Special&#34;, or the product of an earnest rookie writer, just out of college, making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974, &#34;The Gun&#34;. In fact hubby &amp; were disappointed that the closing shot wasn\&#39;t of The Gun being melted down like in the movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I\&#39;m not some NRA shill. It\&#39;s just that when the producer of an intelligent &amp; nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause, I\&#39;d appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn\&#39;t delivered via 2-by-4. Geez!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the sociology lesson is over. The Message has been delivered. The Important Episode has been aired. Now let\&#39;s get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.&#39;

b&#39;This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good in &#34;Koma&#34;) in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to care for hers and Mr. Lam\&#39;s former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so good is director Ann Hui\&#39;s pacing. It takes a while to uncover the secrets of the Lamsm and it all makes sense. The movie is very dramatic and touching. You don\&#39;t feel any repulsion about the teacher/student situation, something that elevates this film above many with the same plot. It is slow moving, but stay with it. Also, revel in Ms. Mui\&#39;s wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. She was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time. It is worth the time to witness and just be there with her.&#39;

b&#39;Viva La Bam was one of those shows that I didn\&#39;t have high if any expectations for, before seeing it, and I never even knew about it until I saw my friend watching it. I had thought Jackass was pretty funny but the stunts were just that, funny and I never really got into the show. When I watched Viva La Bam for the first time it was the complete opposite effect, I loved it. It had more of a TV Show feel to it, which a lot of the &#34;Reality Shows&#34; have today. I was hooked and I wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook up for each episode. All the way to the last episode it held my interest and even though some of the ideas seemed rehashed at times, it always had a newer and funnier twist to it. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that get you hooked and I have yet to see another show that is quite like it.&#39;

b&#39;This is unfortunately Carlin\&#39;s last recorded HBO concert, from a series that lasted over 30 years. Though this may not be his &#34;best&#34; work, it is excellent, funny, and thought provoking. This recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit lengthier than most of his other concerts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout his long, prolific, and influential career, Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes, towards a more \&#39;humanitarian\&#39; viewpoint of society and culture. His focus on the English Language and euphemisms increased throughout the years, and culminates in this performance. Though, I would argue that his audio book &#34;When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?&#34; best displays his vast wit with regards to language, euphemisms, and the breakdown of our values. It\&#39;s Bad For Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church, you will probably not like any of Carlin\&#39;s stand up material. However, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy, you would probably greatly enjoy this concert.&#39;

b&#39;Have you ever found yourself watching a film or documentary and having to hold yourself back from screaming things like &#34;No! Don\&#39;t do it!&#34;? No? Well it\&#39;s time you do. And undoubtedly DEEP WATER is the one to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first round-the-world yacht race to be undertaken by individuals in 1968. That word &#34;individuals&#34; is important, as the men who set off on this nearly suicidal escapade head out alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the men are well-knowns in the sea-faring communities of England (where they launch from), but one of them is the &#34;unknown dark horse,&#34; and his name was Donald Crowhurst. Struggling financially, Crowhurst enlists a backer who can take everything from him should he fail to at least attempt to make it through a large portion of the race. He could take his home, his property, everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crowhurst now finds himself between a rock and ...well ...deep water: either attempt the race with an unproven ship and an unproven captain, or lose everything you own (which was significant since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You\&#39;ll note the term &#34;unproven captain&#34; in there, too. Not only was he unproven, he\&#39;d never been out on the open sea! Did I mention suicidal? Flicking between archival footage of the pre- and post-race, and those of Crowhurst\&#39;s friends, family, and acquaintances of today, Deep Water is put together masterfully. Initially seen as a poor sap who got in over his head, the film gradually shows you the limited choices Crowhurst had after months and months out on the water. His ship leaks. Equipment breaks. Psyche stretched to the breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle with no successful way out. It is interesting, too, to see the psychological breaks that other racers have as they deal with their solitary confinement on-board their respective boats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wave-like emotions that you\&#39;ll feel as you watch this astounding documentary may make you a bit ill (not unlike trying to get your sea-legs). And you\&#39;ll probably be frustrated at the choices being made; perhaps just as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is also amazing in that we get to see the actual ship that Crowhurst sailed, sitting deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach ...not unlike other things that felt deserted and rotting toward the end of this poorly thought-out race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible.&#39;

b&#39;Sure, there\&#39;s stuff here that the Coens and Elmore Leonard have done before, but so what? If you want entertaining, lusty and smart -- &#34;Judas Kiss&#34; is near perfect. Prudes offended by tongue in cheek porn don\&#39;t get it (Talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up -- keeps your investors happy. That\&#39;s independent filmmaking 101). As for the Brits making a bundle, I highly doubt it. This flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of Mr. Tarantino\&#39;s salary. Maybe guys don\&#39;t like it as much as women. I thought it rocked. Go Coco!&#39;

b&#34;It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it. It&#39;s the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the t.v.I wish Lifetime would redo the movie, but use the same actors, and bring it to the big screen.&#34;

b&#39;This film by Fri\xc3\xb0rik \xc3\x9e\xc3\xb3r, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has great music by Sigurr\xc3\xb3s and good acting. It shows how sad insanity as a disease can be. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If that is not a problem then you should see this film. Note though this is not a comedy but a drama.&#39;

b&#34;This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of &#39;The Hollow&#39;. It could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one Christie&#39;s best but what makes &#39;The Hollow&#39; special is the characterisation and I found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In such a uniformly good cast it&#39;s difficult to select stand out performances but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys Lucy&#39;s dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities BUT she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact, Lucy is not really all that nice! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affecting as Gerda. John Christow is really quite an unlikeable character but Jonathan Cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that Midge and Edward&#39;s relationship really comes out of nowhere and I do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! Theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done. The whole thing looks beautiful as well, really capturing a perfect English autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing.&#34;

b&#39;*SPOILERS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t care what anyone says, this movie is friggin\&#39; hilarious. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so they thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie takes place about a year after the second. Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. Meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first is going to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has it all. It has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say &#34;Dada!&#34; like babies. I\&#39;ll have to give the makers of this credit. The snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. I wish that I could get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s the actors. There\&#39;s Manners, the FBI agent from the first movie, except here he\&#39;s wearing an eyepatch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I BE AN FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there\&#39;s the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie isn\&#39;t scary, but is is hilarious. I laughed my butt off the whole way through, and I recommend this for anyone who likes a good &#34;bad&#34; movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out ****&#39;

b&#34;CONTEXT is everything when one goes to rate a movie. When rating this movie one has to consider the time in which it was made. We didn&#39;t really know WHAT the inside of the EARTH was in those days so you can&#39;t rag on the movie too much for the plot (based on a much older book). For the era, this was top notch special effects and the production quality was great. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. For the time the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible as a monster-thing. This is pure movie cheese complete with bad rubber suits, models, and creepy costumes. AWESOME. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!&#34;

b&#34;A lot of people give this movie a lot of crap, and all of it&#39;s really undeserved. People give this movie a hard time either because it&#39;s such a sick subject or they harp on some technical aspect of the movie no one else observes when they watch it. If, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you uncomfortable...DON&#39;T WATCH IT! However, you&#39;d be missing out on one of the better cinematic experiences of the late 1990&#39;s, despite what anyone else says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depths of insanity he plumbs to play this character has to be beyond words, and is much farther than any one of us would have to be willing to go. The acting here is wonderful. The film itself beautifully shot. The subject may be a bit too much for many to swallow, but it&#39;s still well worth your time. If you haven&#39;t seen this movie, check it out.&#34;

b&#34;I learned much from previous viewer reactions. Is there one that does not mention &#39;propaganda&#39;? Too glib. &#39;Perception is concept dependent&#39;. I love Fred Astaire musicals, the great, great songs, &amp; Fred&#39;s peerless grace. But comrades, if you see idle, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden &amp; unemployed, that&#39;s a valid criticism of &#39;capitalist propaganda&#39;. Any movie is steeped in the values of its time &amp; place, not to mention those who fund it \xc2\x96 the pipers who call the tune. Great art transcends all, as did &#39;Nevsky&#39;, as did &#39;All Quiet on the Western front&#39;. I confess. I saw it last 40 odd years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. It&#39;s the greatest battle scene ever likely to be filmed. And it makes you horrified to be thrilled. &#39;Plastic ice&#39; did someone say? That&#39;s real death you&#39;re watching. Real extras died making this. &#39;Real looking&#39; is now special effects-defined it seems. Likewise &#39;too long&#39; - for an age of shrunken attention spans? Mozart had &#39;too many notes&#39;? Propaganda, Catholic Church defamed? The Vatican was STILL at it when they called on ancient favors to get the German Christian democrat gov. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s \xc2\x96 remember the chaos &amp; genocides? Forget the props, the lighting of Nevsky painted the Medieval world \xc2\x96 like a Breughel. There&#39;s one in Hampton Court Palace showing a massacre. Crude Dutch nationalist propaganda maybe, but it tears at the heart. Stylized acting? So what&#39;s Henry V (Olivier movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe English medieval knight-killers talked like that? As said, the music of Prokofiev is magnificent. Only Ken Russell &amp; Eisenstein had the balls &amp; genius to match sound &amp; image at this 100 octane level. OK, you want the snaffle &amp; bit. I&#39;ll risk the nervy thorobred every time. Eisenstein did not copy Wehrmacht helmets, rather, his model seems to have been those buckets worn by &#39;Teutonic knights&#39; in nazi pageants of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius , but unlike Hollywood directors, he had near unlimited (non-commercial) time &amp; funding. Modern Russian directors are free from political shackles, but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (great) movie in communist Russia. He was revered but unfunded in his own country (much like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine sane people from another, peace-loving world. How would they react to Nevsky? Would the battle, or the grieving for the dead dominate their cognitions? If we didn&#39;t know about the gas chambers &amp; SS, what about &#39;Triumph of the Will&#39;? Where can I get a Nevsky DVD, cheap?&#34;

b&#34;This movie is amazing. It is funny, sexy, violent and sick, but it all holds together for a brilliant Troma rendition of Romeo and Juliet. If you don&#39;t mind being grossed out a bit (ok a lot, but it&#39;s funny grossed out), see this movie. It&#39;s worth it!There&#39;s not one level on which it doesn&#39;t deliver. I&#39;ve seen it thrice now, and it is still amazing. I recommend it. Go! Get it!&#34;

b&#39;Before I continue forth with the new millennium, I will go back in time once more because I had completely forgotten about these gems!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1987, Disney, while still a &#34;low&#34; company in the 80s, was able to start a series of films on television called &#34;Not Quite Human,&#34; about a geeky teenager who, like in &#34;Inspector Gadget,&#34; looks like a human but is really a robot!!!!! Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films like &#34;Tron&#34; and &#34;Honey, I Shrunk The Kids&#34; because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents remember seeing this on the TV back then, back when I was just born or something. However, my very first encounter with this film was on the Old Disney Channel (one time, I\&#39;ve seen this, and the other parts, on my 12th B\&#39;day in May of \&#39;99!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Not Quite Human&#34; is a very good series of films to watch, if you can ever find these movies again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has this been shown recently?

b&#39;This new installment to the Child\&#39;s Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying &#34;rude f--king doll&#34; and lots of references to the series: &#34;you can kill me but I\&#39;ll come back. I always come back&#34;. The movie\&#39;s title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn\&#39;t even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones. Chucky seems to interfere with characters from another movie, a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married. There is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere. The movie is very gory, very funny, and has pop culture references from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS ONE BEFORE YOU SEE THE OTHER THREE,. It will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary. Lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#34;The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years. The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable. The comedic timing written into the script is more than enough to make up for a well-worn underdog plot. When you&#39;re sure you know the ending....SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular! Great movie!&#34;

b&#34;I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It&#39;s not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time! Be open-minded, and you will love it!&#34;

b&#39;The true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the game of football out of the &#34;stone age&#34; with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts. But he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. Along the way, he brought fame and glory to a tiny, little, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O\&#39;Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne. Terrific cast that includes Ronald Reagan who gives a great performance as Notre Dame\&#39;s first, true superstar, George Gipp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Football aficionados, this is the greatest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you got the good version, look for a brief cameo by the immortal Jim Thorpe as he sticks his head in the locker room telling Rockne and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins.&#39;

b&#34;Most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by Arthur Miller that is the basis of it. It&#39;s a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and alters peoples lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The eyeglasses his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. There couldn&#39;t have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an everyday man caught in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a stand and walks out of his job. Suddenly, he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the Brooklyn of the 40s. Is he Jewish, is he not? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, directed with sure hand by Neil Slavin, kept reminding me of some Edward Hopper&#39;s paintings, especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when Newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple, menacing and anticipating the confrontation with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Loaf, who infuses incredible depth to the bully-next-door, are excellent, but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of William H. Macy (H must stand for HONEST..) If you haven&#39;t read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than Arthur Miller has.&#34;

b&#39;The large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter \xc2\x96 do we want what we need only when it\&#39;s too late? Or is the irony of the opening scene\&#39;s wailing Cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence? There\&#39;s an endless fascination about where writer-director Roy Andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature, &#34;You, The Living&#34;. With fifty or so semi-related vignettes strung together by a penchant for tragicomic hyper-reality, its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic Sisyphean struggle. The sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to dramatise the tenuity and immense preciousness of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another. Andersson might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should, but he also reminds us of the inherent, reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we\&#39;re all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development.&#39;

b&#34;OK, why complain about this movie? It&#39;s fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see the biography, go watch it. This is an original, fictionalized version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about this, as they do every other deviation of the facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man in which the film is named after was a great idea. I thought it wasn&#39;t so good at first, I&#39;ll be honest. But that just made it even scarier. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you&#39;re obsessed (like some other people) stay away from this movie and all others.&#34;

b&#39;While I agree this was a 1950s sitcom, I don\&#39;t feel it was &#34;typical&#34;. Firstly, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike the regular 50s sitcom moms. She made a stand for women\&#39;s worth and equality (remember the episode where the TV announcer says &#34;just a housewife&#34;) and Donna stands up for all women do and represent, especially those that don\&#39;t work outside the home? And when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was not something trivial...it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the show\&#39;s producer, so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The children were intelligent, but not precocious. They were normal kids. And they could ACT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that made Donna Reed Show stand out was not only did the children LOOK like their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation, which then came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors, and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn\&#39;t seen on the other family shows. And the characters could be flawed, and in major ways, and yet, accepted for the flaws and mistakes. These were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows. They were normal people acting as normal people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women\&#39;s rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but can\&#39;t afford it...it was all shown on this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna Reed show didn\&#39;t last for eight years without a reason. And it could have possibly endured, had it not been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed divorcing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I agree with the original poster, who obviously cares for the show, but I think that the Donna Reed show has SO much more to offer than casual entertainment.&#39;

b&#34;And a perfect film to watch during the holiday season as the winter/Xmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is way cool. It&#39;s weird that Warner decided to release this as a summer film. It doesn&#39;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what&#39;s even weirder, when you consider the content of this film, is that it was aimed at families. An upper-class family throws their mutant baby down the sewer, a socio phobic billionaire dresses up in leather as a flying rodent, a lonely secretary dresses up in leather as a feline and a freak runs for political office. And S&amp;M and bondage are presented in a very perverted way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this film is at it&#39;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and Batman: Dead End are the only true live-action incarnations of the comic-book character. True, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with Batman Forever and the un-nameable one after that, Batman Returns is the best of the four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darker and more violent than the first movie, the sense of Gothic pathos reaches a new high. I was quite keen on Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don&#39;t even get me started on George Clooney!), he displayed the right balance of weirdo loner and cool crime fighter. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much sexier and more &#39;realisticly&#39; cat-like), she wears that leather outfit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as the Penguin that his scenes became disturbing to watch. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as the spooky Max Shreck (if you think you recognise Chip Shrek it&#39;s none other than a very young Leatherface/Butterfinger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danny Elfman&#39;s score is also even better than it was first time round. His powerful and engaging themes are way better than the dross that followed in the later 2 Schumacher movies. This movie is the Batman phenomenon at its Zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after this. Let&#39;s hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale can bring some integrity back to the live action Batman with their movie next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!!!) and as a result there are NO features and the case is a snapper. Pick it up cheap like I did and hope for an SE in the future.&#34;

b&#39;This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a song by Rogers &amp; Hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds out hope. She helps hubby get a job in Cortez\&#39;s company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know, it\&#39;s pretty funny....). Finally he embezzles $5,000 from Cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to Cortez....and I won\&#39;t reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she\&#39;s quite accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; he\&#39;s unattractive and sniveling, while Cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While ostensibly a drama, it\&#39;s filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. But there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point Stanwyck says to Cortez, &#34;My brains are in my feet, while yours are in....&#34; That\&#39;s pretty darn suggestive for 1931! There\&#39;s a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the Code clamped down and whitewashed everything. An amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven\&#39;t come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.&#39;

b&#34;There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. Two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other&#39;s arms (as corny as the expression sounds, that is exactly what happens) and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are. Deepa Mehta&#39;s somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here, since the women -- the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger, more masculine tempered Sita (Nandita Das) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families. As in WATER, FIRE is deeply spiritual, even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, much like the weight of the word, carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition). Even so, it&#39;s a very beautiful picture, and a strong voice from a strong director.&#34;

b&#39;The NYT review says that Sigourney Weaver\&#39;s character is taut and frustrated, and, later, that she could be the sister of MTM\&#39;s character in Ordinary People. Say, WHAT? No way. This lady was quirky from the start. NOTHING like MTM in Ordinary People. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the NYT goes on to say that Sigourney Weaver\&#39;s Sandy Travis and Jeff Daniel\&#39;s Ben Travis are 40-something year olds, &#34;children of the 60s.&#34; Ms Weaver must be dancing a jig. I believe at the time she made Imaginary Heroes she was in fact 55 years old. She was born in 1949.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYT perception corrections aside, this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young. Obviously Sigourney Weaver thought so, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man playing Tim was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some critical comments I could make about the script. Such as that I never really got a good sense of why Sandy Travis missed her son. Her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that such behavior lasted \xc2\xbe of the way through the film I felt had more to do with her stagnation marriage, her relationship with Tim, and where he really came from, and other unresolved issues, than from any mourning of her elder son. Ben\&#39;s mourning was much more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did his mom think so too? Still, a very watchable film. What is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age, rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman (Ms Weaver) and to almost make his film an homage to her. Sort of an anti-Woody Allen.&#39;

b&#39;Some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by political-correctness standards of today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Battle&#34; was an excellent film for several reasons, correctly noted by more rational reviewers: Superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its stars were in effect the D.W. Griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan, that is inducement enough to watch it and to enjoy it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it many years ago and just watched it again at YouTube; that was a very poor quality print, but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater, I can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians.&#39;

b&#39;I must tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely worked out...pretty well actually. However, the film was very good too. Some parts of this movie are really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has great action also. The mystery is pretty hard to figure out and Rose [McGowan] does some &#34;Oscar-worthy&#34; acting towards the end of the film, but I don\&#39;t want to give anything away. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the movie, along with some of the other stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like mysteries, or action movies, or just like Rose...I totally think you would like this movie.&#39;

b&#39;I had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate, so I didn\&#39;t know what to expect. I checked it out on IMDb and got curious. It didn\&#39;t take long to realize that this was a gem. Outstanding performances, great story, and it\&#39;s both well directed and well written. It\&#39;s hard to compare it to other movies, but &#34;Stand by me&#34; comes to mind, although it has as many differences from &#34;The cure&#34; as similarities. The tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and &#34;Stand by me&#34;. Other than that, &#34;The cure&#34; is a fine movie in its own right, well worth a wider recognition. It\&#39;s dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can\&#39;t think of a single thing that bothers me about it. Having said that, I don\&#39;t want to give the impression that it is a &#34;perfect movie&#34;, whatever that means, but rather that I enjoyed it immensely, was very moved by it and wouldn\&#39;t change a thing in it. I won\&#39;t go into a detailed description of the story/plot, partly because it would be either too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. In closing, I can only say: Wonderful movie, see it if you get the chance.&#39;

b&#39;Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an &#34;open&#34; sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie &#34;Black Emanuelle&#34;. It is rich and colorful. Recommended!&#39;

b&#39;When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it &#34;the greatest achievement in the history of the American cinema.&#34; That was not wholly tongue in cheek. TW&amp;TL remains Milius\&#39; best work, and it\&#39;s sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. However, TW&amp;TL remains a striking exposition of what once was known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith\&#39;s superb portrayal of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius--and Keith--admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including &#34;The Rough Riders.&#34;) It\&#39;s hard to fault this film at any level: a splendid balance of action, levity, relationships, and the serious topic of America coming of age in the world. Furthermore, TW&amp;TL has exceptional appeal across the board: note the stats showing it rates best with under-18 males, females 18-29, and over 45! Clearly Candy Bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men.&#39;

b&#39;My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailer of &#34;Nasaan ka man&#34; caught my attention, my daughter in law\&#39;s and daughter\&#39;s so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so\&#39;s Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role. I have never been this touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema!! Way to go, Jericho and Claudine!!&#39;

b&#39;To think this film was made the year I was born. To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of &#34;homeland security&#34;. To think this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I\&#39;ve ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides. It makes you face the issue: are you for the people\&#39;s right of dissent in a time of war, or for the constitution being compromised in the name of &#34;national security&#34;? The protagonists are forced by the government to race to the American flag in a game that undermines the very ideals the flag stands for. The acting is totally convincing. So much so, I can\&#39;t see any acting going on here at all. If this is a scripted documentary, it\&#39;s more convincing than any reality show on television today. PUNISHMENT PARK is possibly the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.&#39;

b&#39;There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a &#34;space&#34; movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner&#34; with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing &#34;Also Sprach Zarathustra&#34; for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been &#34;high&#34; once but I didn\&#39;t go to see it again and again because I was &#34;tripping&#34;. I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else\&#39;s comments if you\&#39;re looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you\&#39;ll find &#34;explanations&#34;, that\&#39;s not my purpose in writing these comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it\&#39;s beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you\&#39;re headed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that\&#39;s too much work for your brain, and you can\&#39;t see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick\&#39;s film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn\&#39;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.&#39;

b&#39;I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to &#34;An American Werewolf in London&#34;, &#34;Jaws&#34;, &#34;King Kong&#34; and even to Peter Jackson\&#39;s &#34;Braindead&#34;/&#34;Dead Alive&#34;, but also to other genres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characterization was better done in &#34;Chicken Run&#34;, but that movie had a complete new &#34;cast&#34; where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new &#34;Wallace and Gromit&#34;-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. &#34;Chicken Run&#34; had the more convenient, but also more &#34;storytelling&#34; plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more &#34;isolated&#34; feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like &#34;Shrek 1+2&#34; and &#34;The Incredibles&#34;, to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation is \xc2\x96 as expected \xc2\x96 superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn\&#39;t put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace\&#39;s inventions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is &#34;borrowed&#34; by Randy Edelman\&#39;s &#34;Dragonheart&#34; score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park &amp; Co.&#39;

b&#39;(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby &#34;B&#34; Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn\&#39;t been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn\&#39;t been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn\&#39;t go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby\&#39;s friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My Comment) The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really didn\&#39;t need a staff. The movie reminded me of the classic movie &#34;Animal House&#34;, the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)&#39;

b&#34;One True Thing proves that it&#39;s the characters which make a movie. Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for her role. A beautiful drama, One True Thing is a prime example of movie-making in the late 1990&#39;s - there are still people out there who care about making and watching movies other than the big blockbusters with million dollar special effects. It&#39;s no Best Picture or anything... don&#39;t be silly. But the amount of emotion that was delivered by both the actors and the writer hit me like a shock-wave. I cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for a 24 year old man.&#34;

b&#39;Im a big horror fan and I quite enjoyed this remake. With all these horror remakes floating about I think this is one of the better attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched it with my two little sisters and I think it made it even better as they were quite scared. Also with the shouting at the screen &#34;Dont do that!&#34;, &#34;Not that way!&#34;, etc. I thought there were some good little jumpy moments and it built the tension well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camilla Belle is absolutely stunning in the lead role and a very good actress - So she holds your attention well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent film.&#39;

b&#39;This movie is a gem...an undiscovered Gerry Anderson classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The origins of both &#34;UFO&#34; and &#34;Space 1999&#34; are obvious from this movie, including the cast list which includes the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell who both went onto &#34;UFO&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unfortunate that Anderson, despite his many TV successes, did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think what he could have done with the movie version of &#34;Thunderbirds&#34; (which he quite rightly disowned himself from!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m sure if you give &#34;JTTFSOTS&#34;/&#34;Doppleganger&#34; a fair chance you\&#39;ll appreciate it\&#39;s good qualities.&#39;

b&#34;I just saw the DVD and loved it. In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I&#39;ve ever seen in a film. I thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that Inman and Ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. I thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. I&#39;m sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me! Jude and Nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together.&#34;

b&#39;Father Hood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across America, but I\&#39;ve seen much worse, and--when I saw this years ago--I didn\&#39;t think it was particularly awful. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the cop chasing them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life. You could certainly do worse--ever hear of the film &#34;Pod People&#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** 1/2 out of *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content matter, violence and language.&#39;

b&#39;Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn\&#39;t animated, critics would be lauding the &#34;direction&#34; in here, because it\&#39;s really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins\&#39; are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the porthole and says, &#34;Hello, breakfast!&#34; Tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says, &#34;You bad old peeping tomcat!&#34; The cat falls into the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship, tiptoes into Tweety\&#39;s cabin, grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there\&#39;s &#34;Granny&#34; at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But, &#34;flippety gibbet,&#34; says Granny, &#34;I\&#39;ve dropped my glasses. I can\&#39;t see a thing without \&#39;em. Heavens to Betsey, where are those cheaters.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again, like Granny\&#39;s glasses. Sylvester\&#39;s most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when she woke up and put them on, she\&#39;d see the bird and think it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes, I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.&#39;

b&#39;One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie only because of him. Obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally. The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the Academy and by most of the critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I know why. First, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare\&#39;s King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia--Rose, Ginny, and Caroline. And I guess &#34;Larry&#34; (Jason Robards) works for &#34;Lear.&#34; The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard. The problem is, in Smiley and Moorhouse\&#39;s story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities. His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem--and this is one I cannot personally attest to, not having read Smiley\&#39;s novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel. Still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen. The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don\&#39;t allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist. Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley\&#39;s novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse\&#39;s alone. She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe. She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age. However it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick. In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them. He ran the household with an iron fist. Jess (Colin Firth\&#39;s character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear. And then he goes to Rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels. I think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong. I think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be. I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty. And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational. They seemed to feed off of one another in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving. In particular Pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred. The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer\&#39;s outstanding performance. And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny\&#39;s character as she went from a &#34;ninny,&#34; as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else. He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back. And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on DVD. My question is, whatever happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film. When she does I hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well. I think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn\&#39;t pay enough attention to the others. In addition to the unnuanced father, Jennifer Jason Leigh\&#39;s Caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did. And the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins. They needed to be engaged and involved.&#39;

b&#39;This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV. It came back to me like a dam flooding over. I have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. After the movie was over I actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours. No movie has ever moved me that way before. I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping I can find a copy to buy so that I can watch it whenever I want to. If someone suggests you see this movie with them, GO....you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peggy Fries&#39;

b&#34;With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye Kira, this is re-Atonement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vera&#39;s ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace. Would work well with French subtitles but then I may have been to too many art house movies lately.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;The Devil in the Dark&#34; is William Shatner\&#39;s favorite episode. It is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the series\&#39; main themes: the respect for other life forms. I do not think one could get a clearer example of one of the show\&#39;s most interesting ideas. In this episode, Kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet. The story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today\&#39;s concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever before. It is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast. One memorable sequence involves Spock joining with the mind of the monster. Plenty of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.&#39;

b&#34;The summary line is some men&#39;s wet dream for the ideal woman ... ;o) Seriously though, back to the movie, which has classic cinema written all over it (pun intended and quite literally shown in the picture, too as you&#39;ll see)! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could someone make a silent movie in this year and age? It&#39;s not completely silent for once (take the music for instance). With great cinematography is the answer. And it&#39;s no wonder that it did win prizes (as another user stated) in this area! But it&#39;s also sometimes it&#39;s downfall. Although the pictures are great, it sometimes delves too much in them instead of moving forward (plot and time wise). If you can cope with that, than you&#39;ll enjoy it even more than me. I haven&#39;t told you anything about the story, but I&#39;ll never do that, because I don&#39;t want to spoiler anything for you ...&#34;

b&#39;I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and did an hour long Q&amp;A afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brilliantly done &#34;documentary&#34;; Herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth. Instead he scripts some scenes and ad-libs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is a real person that you fall in love with; you cheer for him, you feel the anguish that he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the Viet Cong. You are disappointed to hear afterward that Dieter passed on not too long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in most Herzog films, the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music. Especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the Viet Nam war but fitting the story line of Dieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of the film has Dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a POW and he re-enacts his journey with some locals. Harrowing for us to watch, I can\&#39;t imagine what he felt as he was bound again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the Viet Nam war. It should serve as a lesson to us all.&#39;

b&#39;I really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me, emotionally, spiritually and just plain silly stuff. I didn\&#39;t get caught up in &#34;believability&#34; in the screenplay or the actors and didn\&#39;t even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in IMDb for the movie. Listening to Michael Parness talk at the Q &amp; A about his idea of the film, wanting to see how crazy people, or &#34;f\&#39;ed&#34; up people, as he put it, fall in love is really interesting. I identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it\&#39;s best. I like watching David Krumholtz in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now. I believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone, just see this film to watch an amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo D\xc3\xadaz really was a scene stealer, and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment. I laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn\&#39;t win any awards at the festival. I question why that didn\&#39;t happen. I gave Max and Grace a ten because these interesting, unique, creative Indie films deserve an audience. Technically watching this film, it\&#39;s really beautifully done \xc2\x96 the colors are amazing, and lastly, it\&#39;s one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a film in awhile.&#39;

b&#39;After watching this movie once, it quickly became one of my favorites. As different events happen in the movie, you change your mind about Prot, back and forth, until the end and even after. The movie is very thought-provoking and a must-watch!!&#39;

b&#39;I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The primary actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart, and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence. It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.&#39;

b&#39;So ya think you\&#39;ve seen every Mafia movie ever made! Here\&#39;s one that nobody every heard of. It\&#39;s a low-budget, quickie B-movie - shot in the swamps of Jersey. For us mob-movie fans, it had a little bit of everything - sex, violence, cursing, and wise guys acting like &#34;gafones&#34;. While violence dominated the movie, I found myself laughing at some familiar scenes I\&#39;ve since seen on The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of the &#34;Badabing Girls&#34; in the beginning of the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All our favorite mobster stereotypes were featured here. And, as for realism, &#34;fugettaboutit&#34;! Joe Pesci was superb, portraying the classic wise-guy character like we seen him do so many times over the years. This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Pesci fans should run to the video store to check out this flick. You have to look carefully for it since it goes by different names. My copy called it &#34;The Family Enforcer&#34;. Here it is known as &#34;The Death Collector&#34;. But whatever name it goes under, it\&#39;s should be called - A Winner.&#39;

b&#34;Great film, a very worthy 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from its communist oppressors! Based upon a true story tells us how the West throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. Well, it did go away, albeit temporarily. Look who we (the British, amongst others) are now fighting the very same people who the US gave arms, training and money to in the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it, but it does portray a very nice story. However, once the main objective is achieved, i.e. ridding the communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. It told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the US to some detail and was dramatised well. Although being a good film, I will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good (US) v evil (Russia) isn&#39;t your thing!&#34;

b&#39;When you think \&#39;Oliver Stone\&#39; the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like Platoon, JFK, Born On The Fourth Of July, or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually doesn\&#39;t. It\&#39;s a pretty small movie, actually. More than half the movie takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station talking into his mike. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone\&#39;s greatest movies and should NOT be missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all things it\&#39;s a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss, his lover(s), his fans, and even some Nazis. He doesn\&#39;t like his audience and callers and a lot of them don\&#39;t like him (eithor that or do like him, but have no idea why). But, at the end he says on his show: &#34;I guess we\&#39;re stuck with each other.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See Talk Radio, even if you don\&#39;t like Oliver Stone movies. You might be surprised. I sure was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: 10/10&#39;

b&#34;A very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn&#39;t rely on action but on situation, which is all to rare these days. I would compare this film to The Day of the Jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. The acting across the board is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist Carlos and as the Navy man who impersonates him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it&#39;s remarkable considering just how little action there is in it. The first half of the film is all set-up, as the Navy man prepares to impersonate Carlos. The second half is a breathless actioner, the action coming out of the characters and their situations, thus making it all the more gripping. A really tight film that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.&#34;

Lifetime tv has made another movie that everyone is bound to like.&#34;

b&#34;honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i&#39;m even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei&#39;s are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it&#39;s an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can&#39;t ever get enough Gilmore! even in one hour.. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (loralie&#39;s parents, Rory&#39;s grandparents) they&#39;re you&#39;re average rich parents.. Emily president of the DAR and Richard a well known lawyer and Yale alumni st.. Rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier, of course, Rory&#39;s mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and Rory going to Yale did not help her on that journey but believe me, every episode she does get closer ;)&#34;

b&#34;I am an addict of the TV show, the live shows and everything they do. And this was the last piece of work they have done on TV/film as &#39;The League of Gentlemen&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love the series then you will absolutely love the film. It is a nice ending to their TV series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clever and funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers. A must see for any League of Gentlemen fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it!&#34;

b&#34;This film, without doubt, is the clearest example of the British humour the Germans can&#39;t understand. One-liners run rampant in a film spawning one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence amid post-war trials enables Frank Launder to direct maximum talent from all the cast. It&#39;s probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for forceful characterisation (she still wins though). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mentions in Dighton&#39;s masterpiece of English etiquette and stiff upper lip under pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Rutherford/Sim/Grenfell fan would be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83mins long.&#34;

b&#34;In retrospect, the 1970s was a golden era for the American cinema, as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese. This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amazing body of work that remains, is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period. The decade was marked by the end of the Viet Nam war and the turbulent finale of those years of Jimmy Carter&#39;s presidency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing comes out clear, films today don&#39;t measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry, as a whole, has changed dramatically. The big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content, or integrity, as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in revenues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that emerges after hearing some of America&#39;s best creative minds speak, is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary is a must see for all movie fans.&#34;

b&#39;Great music, great dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and actual sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change. I also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality. Of course, it is sappy at moments - it is, after all, a movie musical - but all in all it is a real pleasure - a fun romance and also politically enlightened. This movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines: &#34;I carried the watermelon.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;I don\&#39;t really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I\&#39;ve watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I\&#39;m watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can\&#39;t help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, &#34;Nobody puts Baby in a corner&#34;. (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80\&#39;s films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece&#39;

b&#39;I thought this was very &#34;different&#34; compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly. It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (i.e- Miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. It does not include also the correct format, as in the layout of acts and scenes as I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say you\&#39;ve seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!&#39;

b&#39;In 1937 Darryl Zanuck, who had recently moved from head of production at Warner Brothers, was trying to get his newly created company, 20th Century Fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the glitter palace at MGM. &#34;This Is My Affair&#34; was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century (&#34;San Francisco&#34; &#34;In Old Chicago&#34;)and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily. The plot is fascinating. A trouble maker but heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) is given a secret assignment by President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing American finance. He finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and must decide between love and duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everything about this vintage film works well, but overall it is a good slice of studio film-making. The plot gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for &#34;Mother Night&#34; (the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) and seems quite believable, at least within the confides of studio make believe. As a fan of old movies I am always thrilled when I stumble upon one that I have never seen and &#34;This is my Affair&#34; was no exception.&#39;

b&#39;I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are not any movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said &#34;stupid&#34;. I applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one. She even named one of our calves &#34;Hokey Pokey Keen&#34;!!! I can not say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more films like this one.&#39;

b&#34;Let&#39;s get one thing straight, this gets an 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun&#39;d by everyone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train, and it Delivers! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore itself is really good, and the characters have awesome roles. Come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs, even a Electrical Engineer getting his pimp on! You get to see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore, and a Mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face!! As I mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off, but respectable nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this. There can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but those are some big shoes to fill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid 7 out of 10.&#34;

b&#39;Yet another in the long line of &#34;Don\&#39;t&#34; films of the late 70\&#39;s and early 80\&#39;s yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it\&#39;s the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens\&#39; progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be. It seems Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac, the crazy old crone, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants, and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up. If you are a fan of cheap 70\&#39;s sleaze than this is the film for you!&#39;

b&#39;I remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees I took in when I was looking for a study break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style thrusting-and-parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable Howard Zieff (he did &#34;Private Benjamin&#34;) about a newly widowed doctor\&#39;s aggressive re-entry into the dating game. It all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein (&#34;Casablanca&#34;) along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Charley Nichols has just come back from Hawaii after his wife\&#39;s death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief-of-staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to pacify to keep his residency. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the show\&#39;s discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become about Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby\&#39;s careless supervision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel-wielding skill of surgeons. Matthau is his usual 1970\&#39;s curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty Ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin provides amiable support as Charley\&#39;s colleague, Dr. Solomon. It\&#39;s all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.&#39;

b&#39;This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O\&#39;Malley is the &#34;tramp&#34; and Dutchess is the &#34;lady,&#34; but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phil Harris is our tomcat O\&#39;Malley. You may recognize his voice, as he also furnished the voice of Baloo the Bear in the Jungle Book, and Little John in Disney\&#39;s Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her silky sweet voice to Dutchess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is among my very favorite of the Disney animated feature films, and belongs in any Disney collection. The 2-Disk Special Edition Is Due Out This Summer (2007).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rates an 8.4/10 from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Fiend :.&#39;

b&#39;It is the first time I can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book... In fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than content blended or removed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such as the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had difficulty transmitting, um, communicating, LOL! Or when Tidivinnus was played like a quasi-Sith Lord and got annoyed when the Roman Empire endured a blow, the general ordered for the Empire to..? Ah, watch the movie folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in French Cinema History and for my part it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the Roman bashing and Boar chomping Obelix. Clavier playing the little indomitable Gaul was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling squire of Jean Reno in &#34;Just Visiting.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fight-scene between Artifis and Edifis was hilarious and was nice to see the Matrix theme was not borrowed to despoil an otherwise perfect battle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redbeard the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture, from scuttling their own ship to being the engine for Otis\&#39; (Edifis\&#39; Assistant) invention used at the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand there\&#39;s Asterix and the Olympics with many of the same team back, by Toutatis, I plan to view that too!&#39;

b&#34;I thought that this is a wonderfully written movie. I love little Scamp, and the street-wise Angel. This movie is very easy for little kids to understand, but a good movie for adults as well. I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and that movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp&#39;s Adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation, and unforgettable classic characters. I have loved the movie ever since I saw it for the first time. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with. My favorite song in the movie was Always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original Lady and the Tramp.&#34;

b&#34;***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can&#39;t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted. The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND by way of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure, say. And there wasn&#39;t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here. This series SURFACEd, seemingly, from out of nowhere and, by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling, carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. All things considered, a job very well done. I only hope it reSURFACEs next season...&#34;

b&#39;I didn\&#39;t see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the &#34;Batman&#34; series, &#34;Spawn,&#34; &#34;Judge Dredd,&#34; and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, &#34;why can\&#39;t someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?&#34; And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I\&#39;ve seen in a long time.&#39;

b&#34;I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young &amp; being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it&#39;s hard to decide what makes someone popular. To me, he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that&#39;s how children operate. Popular children are popular because they are in some way &#39;cool&#39;. Popularity is a hard thing to define. So, even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference &amp; he is still left feeling tormented. I found the ending quite distressing as there was no resolution.&#34;

b&#34;No, I have not seen the original series and I won&#39;t compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It&#39;s funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.&#34;

b&#39;This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their &#34;Erasmus year&#34; in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clich\xc3\xa9s about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having experienced &#34;Erasmus&#34; on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences which were similar to the characters (except I didn\&#39;t get laid as often). The movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid American college movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10 (I may not be very objective though)&#39;

b&#39;I just watched this movie on it\&#39;s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) &#34;Mork &amp; Mindy&#34; as a kid, mostly for Robin William\&#39;s zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin\&#39;s journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin\&#39;s struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that\&#39;s the &#34;Taxi&#34; behind the scenes biopic.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those Robin Williams and &#34;Mork &amp; Mindy&#34; fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!&#39;

b&#34;being a high school student,i have to take a health class. this year, the topic is drugs. we learn about the harm they can cause a person. from what we talk about, i still believe and know that drugs can really mess a person up. anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch this. naturally, we groan and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, i actually did enjoy this movie. it was totally real, and not sugar coated at all. the characters were amazing and believable. even the plot was outstandingly realistic and believable. what i liked about this movie mainly was how it got the point of the effect&#39;s drugs can take on an abuser, and the consequences the person has to deal with. everyone reassures themselves that nothing bad will happen to them. well lets get serious. anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this movie shows it. a person can really learn a lot from watching this. it was pretty effective.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;m just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I&#39;ve seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon&#39;s films, so it doesn&#39;t grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). Watch for the feelings, not for their objects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and fleeting, truly like a summer romance, and while being a relaxation to thought and mind, it gives some food for the soul.&#34;

b&#39;This movie is BRILLIANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t remember this movie even BEING in theaters, so thinking it was a &#34;straight to DVD&#34; I have fairly low expectations, even though I am a big fan of Mike Judge. It has some of the same kind of comic future satire as &#34;Brazil&#34; and &#34;Demolition Man&#34;, but taken to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows above-average people having fewer children and the poorest, stupidest, trashiest people having lots of ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution. It takes that concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I don\&#39;t think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking rise of &#34;mild retardation&#34; in the general populace, media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. The lowest common denominator seems to rule, especially in Hollywood and on TV (eg, &#34;Jackass the Movie&#34; and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the political/social satire aside, this movie is also just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! And I don\&#39;t say that lightly; few movies make me actually &#34;LOL&#34;, but this one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the best jokes are word/sight gags in the background, so you really have to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them (like when Joe got his government ID and for &#34;hair&#34; it said &#34;yes&#34; and for &#34;eyes&#34; it also said &#34;yes&#34;). Also, the prison has engraved on the front &#34;House for Particular Individuals&#34;, since the cops in the movie (much like real life cops) call everyone &#34;individuals&#34; instead of people, etc. Again, this was on the screen for just a moment...this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and dissect it to get through the layers of funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I normally watch movies with the subtitles on, and that clued me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix, for instance, the police constantly talk about people &#34;excaping&#34; instead of &#34;escaping&#34;, and there are many other mis-pronunciations that just cracked me up. But again, I might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music/sound effects; it is very subtle but still hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a sci-fi/social satire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on, but overall, I think this is one of those movies that if you DON\&#39;T think it\&#39;s funny, it\&#39;s probably making fun of YOU! I plan on recommending this to many, many people!&#39;

b&#39;A truly terrific, touching film. Female melodrama at its finest, with a lot of comedy: great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it\&#39;s a classic: you\&#39;re in love with &#34;Mr. Right&#34; but he has no interest in you until some guy who seems completely wrong comes along and you fall head-over-heels in love. But of course, it\&#39;s not that simplistic. The characters are real and all of the performances are perfect. The movie is hilarious as well, every scene skewers society. I\&#39;d recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-written screenplay of humor and melodrama. You can relate to every character and the plot moves in unexpected directions. A great, underrated movie.&#39;

b&#34;As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings quite good, and a HUGE step above previous attempts at animating everyone&#39;s favorite Gaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone not familiar with the famous comic series, the show would be hard to follow, but for those of us in the know, it&#39;s a pleasure to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations. You can tell they took the time and effort to really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie and I can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down, but I was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen, any qualms I had were minor by comparison. Minor spoilers follow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief, who has been captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that by the boy teaching them about fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid. In the process, the boy meets the Viking Chief&#39;s daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc etc etc... If my explanation sounds convoluted, don&#39;t worry.. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a great buy.. You can purchase this DVD through Amazon France, but be warned.. Your DVD player probably won&#39;t be able to play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to view it..&#34;

b&#34;Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn&#39;t it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn&#39;t really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there&#39;s an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno&#39;s character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn&#39;t know much about and couldn&#39;t really relate to at the time. He wanders around alone for the most part, he doesn&#39;t meet anyone; I imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something, which is all good, but I still wish he&#39;d trimmed it down from 40 minutes to 15, because it can get incredibly boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after those 40 minutes, things start to get very interesting. I guess I won&#39;t really say more than that because I don&#39;t want to spoil anything. So if you&#39;ve seen the first 15-30 minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off (like I was), just stick with it--it gets a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever, which really made me have to think about what was happening, how characters were feeling and what their motivations were, why things were how they were in this post-apocalyptic world, all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation. And it&#39;s amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors aren&#39;t telling you exactly what&#39;s going on.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Two Hands&#34; is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity. The high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses. The love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is well-directed and well-acted. The band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film.&#39;

b&#34;This movie is just great... It starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses.....well the fun keeps on coming. The power of the movie is perhaps in it&#39;s subtle references to a lot (and I mean a lot) of other movies. For me the best part was perhaps the Bruce Lee/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon scene. How the two actors switches from French to Chinese or whatever Asian language it was, it was awesome. Then the jokes with the names, they are hilarious but perhaps you won&#39;t understand all of them when your an American (no offense). Overall a great movie&#34;

b&#34;1979&#39;s Tourist Trap is a clever, unique B thriller that stands out as one of the best of it&#39;s kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner&#39;s mannequins are a little too life-like for comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the film has hints of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tourist Trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of The Twilight Zone. Director David Schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, that reaches nightmarish proportions. Also, Schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venteran actor Chuck Connors is the best of the film&#39;s decent cast. Pino Donaggio&#39;s music score is excellent, having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie. A number of the film&#39;s sequences are quite memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For horror and thriller fans alike, Tourist Trap is an unforgettable must-see film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** 1/2 out of ****&#34;

b&#34;This is screamingly funny (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#39;s not a big budget-suit controlled blockbuster, but it&#39;s everything it promises to be and more- and BTW- the women are wonderful in their parts, though I don&#39;t know them from other movies, I&#39;d welcome seeing them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for Bruce&#39;s outstanding physical comedy- he is one yummy guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!&#34;

b&#34;This is the first James Cagney film I have ever really watched. I was never interested in his movies before because I figured I wouldn&#39;t like anything in that style of cinema and because I&#39;ve heard most Cagney films are the same. I have to say I really liked it. By today&#39;s standards for movies, it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well.&#34;

b&#39;THE HAND OF DEATH most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to John Woo\&#39;s masterful direction, coupled with Kat\&#39;s superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make for the kind of villains you can\&#39;t help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. It\&#39;s a role reversal the likes of which I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever seen before (Tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, I didn\&#39;t even recognize him at first). Sammo\&#39;s goofy &#34;buck teeth&#34; only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and I believe I actually glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.&#39;

b&#39;One of the best horror/suspense movies I have seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare. I expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare it to &#34;Open Water&#34;, but I disagree because I thought Open Water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same &#34;realistic&#34; style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tears in my eyes at the end. I must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and I am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.&#39;

b&#39;I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. When people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner, well, for me one person would be her. I think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make a great tele movie (Hey, Mr Bogdanovich........). Ida Lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. I can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly AIP film is the late 70s. She was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. One of them is JENNIFER which I think is the last film with a Monogram Pictures copyright. Monogram changed the company name formally to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names on the opening credits. This is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both The Innocents and The Haunting made 8 years later. Really chilling and very creepy, this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film Ida Lupino made and was responsible for. Try and find it...you will always remember it and as I feel, much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer.&#39;

b&#34;Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But as I was watching it, I thought about something. Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. So really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. There is no way that he could&#39;ve gotten away with all of this. Here are all of the unbelievable stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father. Jason(Frankie Munez) couldn&#39;t have gotten away with that. Well, luckily for us, he didn&#39;t. So it didn&#39;t stick with it, the outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Even if the Grandmother was blind, she still could&#39;ve figured out that that wasn&#39;t her granddaughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.They couldn&#39;t have gotten on the plane, flown to L.A., acted like they were coat salesmen, sneak into the studio, and then, and then... Well, some of the film is a little unbelievable. But it doesn&#39;t hurt to tell a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fat liar, though unbelievable at times, is fun. It&#39;s also very funny. But let me just say one thing before I continue this review. If Paul Giamatti wasn&#39;t in this movie, it would really suck. It would be horrible. Big fat liar is also pretty funny, though corny at times. I give it a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fat liar:***/****&#34;

b&#39;My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, &#34;Take it to Limit&#34; Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90\&#39;s rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie. This movie is based on climbing, and I\&#39;m not a climber, yet even I think it\&#39;s hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there\&#39;s a guy in the background who is basically walking up the \&#39;cliff\&#39;. You don\&#39;t want to miss this movie, you\&#39;ll get to see the same clips over and over again. You\&#39;ll get surprises at every turn. You\&#39;ll find yourself quoting the unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Take it snow. Disclaimer: This movie is poorly done, but that is what makes it great&#39;

b&#34;The last of the sequels,not counting Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein which was more or less a spoof.this time count Dracula (John Carridine)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(Onslow Stevens).well good ole Larry Talbot(Lon Chaney Jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing Larry&#39;s werewolfism,but Dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big Franky(Glenn strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie,around 70 minutes and some change,but the action is there,and the great actors are there as well.Lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector,heres some trivia,Lionel atwill appeared in son of Frankenstein,ghost of Frankenstein,Frankenstein meets the wolf-man,and house of Frankenstein. and then this one.if there was another in the series they May have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up,I&#39;m giving house of Dracula 8 out of 10.&#34;

b&#34;This movie was really interesting... it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are - you aren&#39;t. if this was made for an American audience - it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the BBC did! it still is propaganda, in some extend - no film today with these themes can not be - but it dealt with the issue successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a film that should be shown in all terrorism/counter-terrorism courses but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged! A great film in which the BBC took a few risks and unfortunately, London does not need a fictional tale any more, due to the reality of July 7 2005.&#34;

b&#34;Andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. He&#39;s given a good work, everyone is kind to him and to everyone, and he really doesn&#39;t trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend. But in this no-named city Andreas finds soon that a perfect commercials-type world is really not a paradise. Really one of the better movies i&#39;ve seen this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component (cool desaturated photography; cold symmetrical design; unemotional acting; slow, highly controlled camera movements) helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think, as only best films are able to do. Nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern de-humanizer civilization, but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it. Simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground.&#34;

b&#39;This movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad. More true to life characters looking for love, being in love, and loosing it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a classic, superb acting, well written, a real love story set in Chicago, what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SuperB Black Love Story&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;ve never seen the original &#34;House Of Wax&#34; so I really didn\&#39;t know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, &#34;House Of Wax&#34; shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot really doesn\&#39;t matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It\&#39;s all about the special effects here, and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other ghoulish effects as well. The production design and sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their under-written roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, many people are probably wondering just how Paris Hilton\&#39;s performance is. To be honest, Hilton acquits herself quite well, and she doesn\&#39;t portray &#34;herself,&#34; as so many people are predicting. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people\&#39;s opinions about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, moving up from her previous movie, the atrocious &#34;The Girl Next Door.&#34; Her character is put through a lot, and Cuthbert proves to be a feisty heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is pretty to look at, but unfortunately is not very convincing as the &#34;bad boy&#34; of the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I predict good things for &#34;House Of Wax,&#34; as the audience at the screening I attended hollered, screamed and clapped through out many parts of the movie. Congrats to the cast and crew for a job well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a congrats to Paris Hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. Like she always says - &#34;That\&#39;s hot.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;One of Alfred Hitchcock\&#39;s three greatest films, along with &#34;Psycho&#34; and &#34;The 39 Steps&#34;, &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34; is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It\&#39;s the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can\&#39;t even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows all about Guy\&#39;s problems with his no-good wife Miriam, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno\&#39;s father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. Guy laughs it off, but Bruno ain\&#39;t kidding, as Guy finds out to his peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a great premise for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34; a run for all its worth, with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film, including Anthony Perkins in &#34;Psycho&#34;. While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay-dar, but Guy seems happy enough on love\&#39;s rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno\&#39;s interest for Guy could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting Mommy file his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Oh, I certainly admire people who do things,&#34; Bruno purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. &#34;You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, Bruno calls himself a &#34;bum&#34;, accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks Guy\&#39;s life with his homicidal meddling. It\&#39;s the ultimate perverse underdog\&#39;s tale. There\&#39;s a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly. When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who\&#39;s actually happy for him? I think not, yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don\&#39;t want Bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his \xc3\xa9lan as he tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. (&#34;20 Big Shows&#34; the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren\&#39;t kidding.) Script, camera-work, a gripping tennis match, Ruth Roman\&#39;s jaw-dropping figure, it\&#39;s all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can call this a clinic in movie-making, but &#34;clinic&#34; sounds too dull. &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34; is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck, I\&#39;ll take that ride over again in a second!&#39;

b&#39;I liked this film very much, as I liked before the other movies by Cedric Klapish. All the actors, coming from all over Europe, are very good and funny. One can really feel the influence of &#34;Amelie&#34;, like in many other recent movies, but it\&#39;s ok.&#39;

b&#34;i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn&#39;t put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a &#39;escape pod&#39;, a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a &#39;scanner&#39; thing. that is it for props. Maybe this is even a good thing, forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film, as the centers of the work, instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make CGI fights (starwars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cgi is fine. It is not exactly &#39;seamless&#39;... but imho it still works. why? because there isn&#39;t too much of it, and what there is, is not &#39;taking over&#39; with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot. it prompts the imagination... it&#39;s some relatively simple stuff, with decent composition (especially the heavy freighter shot.. there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds...that tracks the entire length of the ship... it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 0.75 seconds), and some relation to the story. it might look old or not &#39;state of the art&#39;, but it doesn&#39;t look stupid and it doesn&#39;t take away from the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good, except the characters die too fast to get to know them. The captain was great, but a few of his scenes could have used another take. I also got confused with his character losing his cool and stomping on a corpse, I like to think captains are calm cool and in control... what was going on in that scene? did the other crew worry about him losing it at that moment? did he feel himself losing control? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for the plot.... mostly it is good... why? Because it doesn&#39;t try to explain itself. It just happens. It&#39;s called &#39;the planet&#39;, its a mystery, get it?? Nobody knows why there is a statue, and they don&#39;t find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird scientist with the tattoo? What do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes? This isn&#39;t War and Peace. And, thank god, it&#39;s not star wars/trek either. No midichlorians, no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story. The characters are stranded, and are only able to figure out a few basic things... it is not a star trek episode where they find out it&#39;s leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer. It is mysterious, and i liked that. I don&#39;t know why, maybe I can identify with these guys more , since they don&#39;t know whats happening, and i don&#39;t either... they don&#39;t talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the &#39;traitor&#39; turns on the crew, and tries to &#39;explain&#39; the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. This coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog, imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, sometimes I felt it was a little too mysterious, though. Like, why did the guy get fried through his eyes with lightning? That was odd. Just weird. The &#39;hamlet&#39; ending... again I would have liked to have known some of these characters better. And would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show, it was a film, and we like closure in films, even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet with no &#39;flights of angels sing thee to thy rest&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways. What can I say. This was well worth the dollar I payed at the &#39;red box&#39; machine at the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3. Like I said, it sucked me in, wanting to know what was happening, and I couldn&#39;t stop watching until the end.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;ve just seen this movie, and it made me cry. It&#39;s a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love, and i think it&#39;s a good idea, especially for the closed-minded, to watch this one. I have come to love the short-film genre after just having seen a couple, because they have to make an impression on you so fast, and i have to say that this one definitely sat it&#39;s mark. It described some things, that i haven&#39;t ever really thought about that way, incest for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending. Just once i would like to watch a gay-themed movie without wanting to kill myself after wards. They seem to pretty much always end in tragedy. It was &#39;cute&#39; though, how that they had to be together, even if it was in death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it eight stars, and i recommend it too everyone, cause i think it gives an &#39;inside-look&#39; in the world, that this movie make you enter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening, enjoy.&#34;

b&#39;Every time I watch this film, it just really makes me wanna go out and have a good night! My mate uses &#34;the weekend has landed&#34; speech to psyche himself up before going out! and so do I...sometimes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a great debut for the writer/director - well done mate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is great, all the characters are believable and are larger than life! The \&#39;weird\&#39; scenes are a joy to watch, Jip\&#39;s running Mr floppy flashbacks/explanations/visualizations are all great! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national anthem is a laugh too. There\&#39;s loads of comedy here - Howard Marks\&#39; \&#39;spliff politics\&#39; speech is hilarious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh god, you just need to see this. Mind you, I felt the film did somewhat glorify the use of ecstacy, but hey, that\&#39;s the truth of the matter eh? At least the film doesn\&#39;t shy away from this fact. I suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well - don\&#39;t take life TOO seriously, you have to let you hair down sometime. And of course the chat in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his mates that he\&#39;s coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come down\&#39;s out-way the good times, you know the party\&#39;s over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is at times a very clever film in it\&#39;s use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was a realised piece of cinema, and a great feel-good tale of mates, love, clubs, and drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get outta the \&#39;rat race\&#39; people!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&#39;

b&#34;A fantastic movie, and very overlooked. Gary has never been more handsome, and Ingrid is more beautiful than in ANY other film. If you don&#39;t believe, just watch the movie. Every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will make your pulse race! The story is great, the script is Oscar caliber. Don&#39;t miss this film!!&#34;

b&#34;Meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him, while leading his CIT&#39;s into once mischievous scheme after another! The cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. It is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must-see. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the camp social - while Bill Murray hams it up for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) By far, one of my very favorite comedies of all time!&#34;

b&#39;I can honestly say that &#34;Death Bed: The Bed That Eats&#34; was a much better movie than I expected. Allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. It eats people. Several unsuspecting women on an &#34;outing&#34; of some kind, stumble across the sinister &#34;sack&#34; and ultimately fall prey to it\&#39;s hunger. The bed\&#39;s devouring process consists of a yellow foam soaking people into it\&#39;s inner... stomach acid; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult flick and the only film from George Barry who had forgotten he made it until word-of-mouth of it\&#39;s newfound cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on DVD. Not a bad movie at all, if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects - the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking skeletal fingers... Pretty dreamlike tone to it, too, coming across as very surreal and aberrant - mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed. If you like bizarre no-budget, oddball flicks than definitely seek out &#34;Death Bed&#34;.&#39;

b&#34;Just watched this and it was amazing. Was in serious doubt about renting the DVD or not. So if you are...and like watching other than brainless action-movies...don&#39;t hesitate any longer. Don&#39;t let the dull cover put you off. The script is one of the best ever. Inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie. I had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy, and usually I get bored on watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and didn&#39;t have any boring moments. It also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the acting is great (one of Kevin Spacey&#39;s best roles). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well-chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say about it....well....I can&#39;t really find anything......Enjoy! 10 out of 10&#34;

b&#39;Cinema\&#39;s greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy\&#39;s Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France\&#39;s New Wavers caught everyone\&#39;s attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, &amp; Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti\&#39;s particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He\&#39;s not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. &#34;Incidents&#34; are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century\&#39;s great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler\&#39;s 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler\&#39;s ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it\&#39;s a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinema just doesn\&#39;t get better than this. I\&#39;ll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it\&#39;s too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach\&#39;s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie\&#39;s thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it\&#39;s mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde\&#39;s jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde\&#39;s dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It\&#39;s ostensibly in English, but the DVD\&#39;s sound seems muddy and there\&#39;s a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#34;After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both based upon comics by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately, I was not able to see them in order, as this is the third in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts great as The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) is escaping from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) did manage to get a cuff on her, but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away. If that isn&#39;t bad enough, later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn&#39;t put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But, they don&#39;t hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon they are dropping like flies. Some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder. The madam (Reisen Lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. She&#39;s in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has been supplying her with food. (The story O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting, but only incidental to the movie.) They try to burn her out, but this is The Scorpion, and she has some unfinished business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the usual mix of sex and violence, this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout.&#34;

b&#34;Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones. It features a kid-sized story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not preachy. Hayao Miyazaki has fused Andersen&#39;s Little Mermaid with Japan&#39;s native myths and his trademark steam punk flights of fancy, and the result is very rewarding. There are some scary moments of oceanside storms and flooding, but they are thrilling, not horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve ever wanted to run with the waves along the shore, ride on a jellyfish as an elevator, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.&#34;

b&#39;Looking back on Jim Henson\&#39;s works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time. For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to, or worse yet cynically exploit, children nowadays, Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this, Labyrinth aside, it is 1979\&#39;s Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in children\&#39;s television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television, The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive, understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended, the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here. I have said it in other comments, but I must say it here. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes. In short, precise strokes, we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors. And when the story proper begins, boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show. They were living things based upon a part of all of us, only writ so much more boldly than we are used to. As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn, we saw another reflection of part of ourselves, and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. Hence, everyone had a favourite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays, I am more of a Swedish Chef fan, but what the hey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song to me was Gonzo\&#39;s number, asking what he is and where he came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and, like Gonzo, saying we knew we would be going back there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If any evidence were required that present-day &#34;musicians&#34; have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable, this number would be it. Never before, and never again, would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal. Cameos literally pepper the film, with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets, appears to set up a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks\&#39; cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy, but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The big acting strength, though, comes from Charles Durning, who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist. At every junction, Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind. Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hopper\&#39;s attempts to ensure Kermit\&#39;s compliance become progressively more forceful and violent. The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend. In point of fact, Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment. And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since. That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes. There can be little doubt that in today\&#39;s world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities, Henson\&#39;s creature workshop could never have got off the ground. To misquote the album title, daring to be stupid is one thing, but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter. The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside of the proverbial box. There will never be another entirely like him, but he never would want us to stop trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated, this would be it.&#39;

b&#34;I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don&#39;t think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was lying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can&#39;t remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of indy films. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.&#34;

b&#39;After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain\&#39;s Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, &#34;we would rather surrender to this German\&#39;s dog than to you Italians.&#34;) The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can\&#39;t understand,) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;

b&#39;Like Margot in &#34;Fear of Fear&#34; falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in &#34;Fox and his friends&#34; is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in &#34;The Stationsmaster\&#39;s Wife&#34; who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German &#34;Wirtschaftswunder&#34;-Society after World War II in R.W. Fassbinder\&#39;s &#34;The Merchant of the Four Seasons&#34;. Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between hetero- and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favorize any sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Hans Epp\&#39;s case there are the women who drive him into despair, illness and finally death. When he comes back from the Foreign Legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother, she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. After having lost his job, he works as a fruit-merchant with little income, going from backyard to backyard &#34;crying out&#34; his produce. His mother, one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a &#34;street-worker&#34; in their family. &#34;The love of his life&#34; (she has no name in the movie) refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin. So he marries Irmgard whom he does not love and who does not love him. From her constant pressure on him he flees into drinking. One evening, after his wife was stalking him, he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for. When Irmgard is calling a lawyer for divorce, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on, he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol. So he starts to feel more and more superfluous, gets quieter and quieter and more and more depressive. When he finds out that Irmgard cheats him, he chooses to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann by having a trip into the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death in front of Imrgard, their little daughter and his boozing buddies. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however is: Did Hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment, or did he make self-justice?&#39;

b&#34;I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was mesmerized. The only Japanese horror film I had seen before this one was KWAIDAN (Which I proudly own on DVD, by the way), superb! The idea of a town being absorbed by spirals sounds exactly like something out of Lovecraft. Certainly it reminds one of SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants slowly turning into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope we will soon see this one available on Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance has recently screened it on US TV, hopefully they&#39;ll do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!&#34;

b&#39;There have been many (well, more than a few in any case) attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has an &#34;otherworldly&#34; appearance. Supposing that this is a Film Director\&#39;s wish to distance himself from other movies, or simply to gloss over the low-budget and shabby look, &#34;Begotten&#34; is on the top echelon of this pile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the peerless &#34;Eraserhead&#34;, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merhige\&#39;s painstaking process of artificially degrading his film changes it\&#39;s structure completely (imagine what this film would have looked like in glorious, standard Technicolour) - It can almost be envisaged as an artifact from another, unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they disturb mainly as they are dislocated. This is not &#34;Last House On The Left&#34; disturbance, more like leaving-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-seeing-the-sun disturbance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this Fever-Dream if you get the chance, and relish. Remember, they make other, more standard films every day. They can wait.&#39;

b&#39;While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age 22) she asked me &#34;Since you\&#39;ve been watching movies since 1938, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?&#34; Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is &#34;THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES&#34;. This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl\&#39;s fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who\&#39;s life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son\&#39;s new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank\&#39;s loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art.&#39;

b&#39;This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England. By some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old Judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. The story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy Rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... But the film is not about this, even. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. She did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.&#39;

b&#39;Business vs. personal conviction. Profit vs. art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes. This is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to remember one thing from this movie, it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves, they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as MacDonalds used to do for the fast bite (something Parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a Burger King sign). &#34;It is all about image&#34; against content as another interviewee says. That is the easy way, the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature, easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again. Controlled branded taste is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are &#34;levelling&#34; the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the &#34;grey masses&#34;. Individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck. It is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization, even across the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in many other areas of today\&#39;s world, dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all... let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum-packed &#34;more of the same&#34;. Standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this, I am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy &#34;sante&#34;.&#39;

b&#34;This movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. However, I have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of Paul Anthony as Pip. He made the well written parts very believable and affecting, and the more weakly written parts much more bearable. Also, I have to mention the performance by Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in a part like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why haven&#39;t I seen more of him? Someone give him more roles, please!&#34;

b&#34;if you are going to see this movie, by all means don&#39;t go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down. yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller masqueraded as a comedy. the performances are very good especially by jeff goldblum as the head of the election company. even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression. of course robin williams is excellent.laura linney is very good too what a surprise. she is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood and one scene in particular shows this. this film makes you think. what if a comedian ran for president and actually won? would the country be better off or would the country shatter into a million pieces?&#34;

b&#39;I first was made aware of this film when I saw a preview before another movie. I was intrigued but it didn\&#39;t get to see it before it\&#39;s short run in theaters was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an easy movie to watch multiple times. There is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette\&#39;s lines sums up on. &#34;To Americans if it didn\&#39;t happen on TV it just didn\&#39;t happen&#34; There is a lot of truth to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an American Citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass. It doesn\&#39;t work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenery is beautiful. The acting is all decent. THE PROFESSOR is especially good. Mainly though I care about these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine but their appearance is short, so they don\&#39;t matter much. Patricia has guts. In the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly. As it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi, is the female political leader in the movie. In real life she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only recently released from house arrest. The W. Bush administration, as of the date I write this, is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re-form the government. The Burmize government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic. The U.S. Government has yet to recognzie the new name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don\&#39;t wnat a message in your movie don\&#39;t watch this one. If you don\&#39;t mind a little educations with your entertainment then it\&#39;s a fine one.&#39;

b&#34;Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one, which was released in the summer &#39;04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film&#39;s faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, setting and style was three fold as effective as in the first movie. In the first we were given basic action, well animated and choreographed animation, but nothing eye popping, however this movie&#39;s cinematography was exceptional, the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation was very good. It rivalled Disney, however since this is a movie about TV characters, there was nothing exceptionable about the character design or detail to the actual characters, however, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice the amount of cels for each second because there was absolutely nothing jittery about the animation at all, it was incredibly fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music... I think that&#39;s where this movie fails. The original composer/conductor for the TV show was used for the film, and I don&#39;t really feel that he did that good of a job. The music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesisers used for the film couldn&#39;t convey the tune very well. However they didn&#39;t fail the film at all, adding as a good accompaniment to the action. But, except for a few violin/string pieces towards the end and some choral work, the music didn&#39;t excel any boundaries or act as anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was fun. It was a reasonably typical storyline for Naruto and was very similar to the first movies, except, again, it took everything that had been wrong with the first film&#39;s story and improved upon them. The characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film. It kept making you think the film would be ending any second now, but then it would move on, but instead of feeling dragged out, the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this film is a goodun, but however good it might be, it is most definitely one for the fans. I enjoyed the film, but thats because... I&#39;m a fan! But I can see, just like with Final Fantasy&#39;s Advent Children, it doesn&#39;t excel as a movie, but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half. Though I think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current non-watchers, it won&#39;t give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of upsetting fillers.&#34;

b&#34;Now, I&#39;ve seen many many B-grade films in my 15 years of living, and I must say that this was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the real estate and the storyline, but it did suffer from amateur acting (although Adrienne Barbeau did give a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms couldn&#39;t hold his part well enough to be considered good. The other performance which really fit the film was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It begins with an eager real estate agent taking an Asian couple through a house, only to find there&#39;s a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. It progresses with detective speculating, and introduces the key characters with reasonable grace. I think that for any person who&#39;s in for a giggle at the over-the-top drama the victim realtors provide during the over-the-top gory scenes, this truly is a gem... XD Who am I kidding? It&#39;s not that great, but worth a watch if you&#39;re insanely bored.&#34;

b&#39;Even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. Their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. It parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good movie. 7/10&#39;

b&#39;This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, &#34;By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the &#34;Claw&#34; or Saw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is worth watching&#39;

b&#34;This is a made for TV movie by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality movies that are family orientated. Just Desserts is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie. Two bakers competeing for a $250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers. It is fun and light hearted. The desserts look great. The movie has a catchy, upbeat little song played during the competition. I assume that it is a made for the movie song by Roger Bellon. To bad that no soundtrack is available. I would really like to get a copy of the song. I don&#39;t even know the name of the song, because the credits are squished at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promos. Anyway, the cast is great. It is always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and upbeat. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. The movie is worth watching.&#34;

b&#34;I don&#39;t know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre. I really don&#39;t. Dark -yes, bizarre - no. It i s sad and with lots of emotions, specially with the Pinguin&#39;s story. They say it has elements of S&amp;M but I really don&#39;t find anything of that sort except for Catwoman&#39;s whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren&#39;t just some crazy freaks dressed like on a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) isn&#39;t just a sexy chick who likes steeling jewels - she&#39;s on her personal crusade and Pinguin... well, by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Again, I think Michael Keaton is the best Batman and he carries his costume well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can totally see that it is a Tim Burton movie, because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions.&#34;

b&#39;The vampire &#34;craze&#34; has, in my opinion, actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization. There were many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries. I\&#39;ve reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I\&#39;ve recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and, coincidentally, features my favorite horror staple). I\&#39;m going to now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn\&#39;t see as of now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of &#34;guy&#34; and &#34;girl&#34; vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into &#34;sides&#34;. I think men are prone to hate Stephenie Meyer\&#39;s work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated. Women may be unlikely to enjoy future &#34;neutral&#34; pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times. We need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying (unequally) if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable, or it is a floundering mess that doesn\&#39;t decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one. Don\&#39;t let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. Its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action films. Its protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). Still, his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived, and his attention is returned. There is a male slant to this picture, yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot follows an Emile Zola novel called Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se Raquin, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her. The two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man\&#39;s body between them. They are thus driven to insanity, but care for the woman\&#39;s ailing mother. At the novel\&#39;s conclusion, they try to kill each other, discover each other\&#39;s plans, and commit suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, transcribe this nearly 150 year old French novel into modern South Korea and you\&#39;ve got Thirst. Chan-Wook doesn\&#39;t embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative. His use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect. See it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine. He thus becomes the god he once was smitten with. People flock to him and view him as a grand healer. OK. That\&#39;s really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship. Yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it. Instead of confronting the delusional people, he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s continue with the Christian allusion. The woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-law\&#39;s treachery (finger waggles). The man kills her but resurrects her. The two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans. The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him. They both die, but he atones for her crimes (and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman character is a caricature, and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife with no education, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism magnifies their characteristics. She becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention.&#39;

b&#39;I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers\&#39; funny, but sick, twisted, I can\&#39;t believe she just said that but it\&#39;s so damn true funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Bohl, who deservedly won Best Actress, is amazing to watch. There\&#39;s never a moment when you think oh, I\&#39;m watching a movie and she\&#39;s an actress. She\&#39;s too damn real for words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact there\&#39;s 2 scenes that I\&#39;m still giggling over, and I won\&#39;t give them away, but in one she\&#39;s in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how &#34;awesome&#34; it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another she talks about a teenagers definition of &#34;sex&#34; versus an adults, and if it isn\&#39;t the truest dialog I\&#39;ve heard in a movie in a long time, I don\&#39;t know what is.&#39;

b&#34;I know a lot of people have said don&#39;t bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles. That is a really lazy way to think of a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else, and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art, this being a masterful piece of work. If you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really. There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.&#34;

b&#34;I recently got THE SEVEN-UPS on video and I must say it was a very enjoyable movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is great as psycho henchman Moon. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty bland but that&#39;s only to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie. I think it should be a film that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute of it. The final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN-UPS does not disappoint.&#34;

b&#39;A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. Nicknamed &#34;Good Time Charlie\&#39; his antics amuse everyone at first. His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50\&#39;s and 60\&#39;s Lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact. Unlike Disney\&#39;s animated talking animals the animals in these films remained true to their own nature. They also make great travel films for seeing the western states.&#39;

b&#39;My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have. I still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic (albiet syrupy) final scenes.&#39;

b&#39;The movie &#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; comes from first-time writer-director Liev Schreiber, adapting Jonathan Safran Foer\&#39;s first novel. The book was ambitious and sprawling, its magical-realist elements and vivid use of language seemingly impossible to represent on screen. The movie, wisely, attempts less. While the end result is not as wildly original as the novel, it\&#39;s still an accomplished movie about a strange Eastern European road trip, or, as one of the characters would have it, &#34;a very rigid search.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That character is Alex (Eugene Hutz), a young Ukrainian man who loves American pop culture but can\&#39;t seem to get the English language straight. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), who runs a tour company catering to American Jews, convinces him to serve as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan is investigating his family history, and specifically trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. More than one family secret gets revealed during their quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s Jonathan (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a semi- kleptomaniacal weirdo who steals his own grandmother\&#39;s dentures to add to his collection of &#34;family things&#34;. Wood\&#39;s quiet, wide-eyed, earnest manner works very well in this role. Hutz makes an impressive debut as the loose-limbed, easygoing Alex. His malapropisms are hilarious, but he is also able to pull off the character\&#39;s growing self-awareness. The dog Mikki is very funny as the demented Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and one of the few movie dogs I\&#39;ve ever seen that isn\&#39;t cloyingly cute and precocious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; eventually puts the Holocaust on a human scale, asking us to remember it not as a general event, but as millions of specific, small tragedies. Reminiscent of a European movie, it also ponders the effect of past events on present-day young people like Jonathan and Alex. With its original perspective, strong performances and some very striking visuals, &#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; is great work for a first-timer, and hopefully Schreiber will continue to direct movies.&#39;

b&#39;Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak sound track, it is far superior to its competition at the time, &#34;Octopussy.&#34; Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery\&#39;s least popular bond flick). NSNA is rich with clever dialogue, wit, smarts, sex appeal, and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA features a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as, &#34;Mr. Bean.&#34; I wouldn\&#39;t trade any of the Moore pictures for this one. However the earlier Connery/Bond efforts (with the exception of &#34;Thunderball,&#34;) are superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#34;MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago. I&#39;ll have to see what other memories might be hiding on the web. By the way I try to do computer animation thats where the johnl3d comes into the picture&#34;

b&#39;If you\&#39;re familiar with the work of auteur Johnny To and his band of filmmaking cronies over at Milky Way, you know what to expect with this latest production. All the familiar elements are in place: the strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a cop and a baddie, the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end, and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films like &#34;Longest Nite,&#34; &#34;A Hero Never Dies,&#34; and &#34;Where A Good Man Goes&#34;) portrays a hostage negotiator/cop who is on the robber\&#39;s tail, even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, poignant, and cool while being subtle, &#34;Running&#34; is actually one of the most entertaining Milky Way films to date. Don\&#39;t miss the performances by the two leads, esp. Andy Lau, usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch. This film is one to go out of your way to see.&#39;

b&#34;The war at home is a splendid television series and I don&#39;t understand because she has been annulled. Please fairies something to continue with this very beautiful television series, with excellent and marvelous actors, good recitation and good situations, please we want the third series and even so many new episodes. I pray you!!!! I would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested forehand, since I can tell you that here in Italy this series is very liked, as in other countries of Europe chest of drawers for example Spain. In effects as I have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated. I think both one of the best American television series arrive on the Italian screens in these last years.I pray you!!!!&#34;

b&#34;Opera (the U.S. title is terror at the opera) is somewhat of a letdown after some of Dario&#39;s other movies like Phenomena, Tenebre, and Suspiria. (i still can&#39;t find Inferno anywhere.) it&#39;s one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it&#39;s like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan. this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion. he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she&#39;ll gouge out her eyes. this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory Argento fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical. (this is especially directed towards the killer&#39;s motivations. i still haven&#39;t completely figured out why he&#39;s such a nut.) the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, for about the first hour or so this is some of Dario&#39;s best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking. too bad it couldn&#39;t maintain it through to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rating:7&#34;

b&#34;I will admit I possibly missed tiny moments when I wasn&#39;t paying proper attention, but I got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film, from director Lionel Jefferies, who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in Victorian London. One night the Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them, and does not return. They move to a cottage in the country, and here the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, who I first saw in Child&#39;s Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. Everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as Mother/Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!&#34;

b&#39;In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid\&#39;s shows that I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head, I recall him wearing a variety of Elton John-type shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He &#34;played&#34; piano, and had a Jesus looking dude in a white tux, sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one else I know remembers it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit as a previous post said, it wasn\&#39;t just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden (another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one.) People always talk about LSD\&#39;s effects of music and movies of the 70s, but it seems kid\&#39;s show writers got a dose as well.&#39;

b&#39;This solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly contrived) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His hapless, nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals Chevy Chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about the film that appealed to me the most, however, is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel. They add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its &#34;suspense&#34; from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be watched for its comedy value (which is high indeed). Besides Gustafsson, Lars Amble\&#39;s solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heartily recommend.&#39;

b&#34;A gem from Japan, where so many of the world&#39;s best films are being made today. Stylistically, this isn&#39;t anything all that special. It&#39;s just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for voicing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50 year old spinster. She&#39;s takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she is done with this part time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, which made this Army of Darkness fan giggle). Along her milk route lives a 50 year old man, whose wife is dying. It turns out the milk woman and the man, a child services worker, dated in high school, and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other. The film actually has some major narrative problems. When the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique. The climactic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters, as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down, but never end up doing so. I think the best thing in the film is Tanaka&#39;s heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems were, the film mostly transcends them.&#34;

b&#39;This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce\&#39;s writing brought to life. His novels are all unfilmable (in any real sense) and this is the only long story he wrote. It was John Huston\&#39;s last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died, and it is easy to see his touch of greatness. The Dead is poetical in its approach on the screen, telling us more about Ireland than any modern movie on the IRA and &#34;the troubles&#34; could ever hope to tell us. Hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both John Huston and James Joyce, and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore (and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper).&#39;

b&#39;When Melville\&#39;s &#34;Pierre; or The Ambiguities&#34; hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication since &#34;Moby Dick&#34; a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of &#34;POLA X&#34;. Newspapers even published headlines like: &#34;Melville Insane!&#34; which, of course, he wasn\&#39;t. But, when one compares the writing styles found in &#34;Moby Dick&#34; and &#34;Pierre,&#34; one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. Clearly, he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal &#34;Moby Dick.&#34; He was not content, however, to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted, and that surely would have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted, cynical one, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternate title: &#34;The ambiguities&#34; is quite appropriate. As Pierre searches for, and thinks he finds, truth, we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe. As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;POLA X&#34; is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, set in modern or nearly modern France. Though, in some ways, it leaves little to the imagination, and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at, the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact. The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask, yet the answers are left to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than &#34;Moby Dick,&#34; before seeing this movie. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film.&#39;

And what can you say for the rest of the cast? An all-star lineup, Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver, and Kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats.

I also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn.

b&#34;It is movie about love,violence,illegal affairs and romanian tycoons. A romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern European audiences that HAVE LONG forgotten about the conservative comunist regim over film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood. Two young men do illegal car races. They work together as a team and prosper from their occupation ,but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very tensionated movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant acting both by Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director Radu Muntean also give a unique charm to Furia. All this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the filmlovers around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race ,language we speak or country. It is a real hope for the Romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy watching it as I&#39;m sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it.&#34;

b&#34;I wasn&#39;t expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It&#39;s noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it&#39;s star, John Garfield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. Before the term &#39;Method&#39; was even coined and before Brando ever screamed &#39;Stella!&#39; he brings &#39;natural&#39; to the screen. His earthy quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that &#39;Golden Boy&#39; role he so desperately wanted to covet on screen. Garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer, proving his acting worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as Jack&#39;s trampy girl Goldie. I haven&#39;t ever thought much of Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well off Garfield. Dickson&#39;s&#39; performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield seems their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is miscast, and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene. Strange, as he always was such a reliable actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also interesting to note is the director- Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. He maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good film that deserves greater attention 8/10.&#34;

b&#34;The accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. A lot of sadness. I&#39;m sure glad that I wasn&#39;t him....another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women. But, I don&#39;t think that it was about the women, although it was to JFK Jr&#39;s passion. What a shame. any loss of life is a real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like a good account of his life. I recommend it if you are into biographies and melodrama!&#34;

It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city, one of the greatest city in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam, the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or may signify once again, as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. An then, like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial romances, and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects, like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedral-shaped hamam (Turkish bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.&#34;

b&#39;The people of my generation and those who are older know about the WW II (or as it is called in Russia \xe2\x80\x93 the Great Patriotic War) not only from the school textbooks, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. My granddad was a soldier at Stalingrad and when I was a small girl I used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. But it was long ago, and no when I have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. Somehow most films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in present day Russia. And \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d is an exception. In the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I\xe2\x80\x99m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film reminds me a great deal of Remarque\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cZeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben\xe2\x80\x9d, because the war is shown through an ordinary German soldier perception. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. The movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said \xe2\x80\x9cIf you start thinking, you will go mad\xe2\x80\x9d. And to my mind it is true for spectators as well. From the one hand, one may think, OK, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just watch this movie and it won\xe2\x80\x99t dissipate me, I needn\xe2\x80\x99t feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. However sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolya\xe2\x80\x99s execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I know, Lt. Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched quite many Hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as \xe2\x80\x9cNext\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cTranssiberian\xe2\x80\x9d (why did he do it?!). And after I had watched \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d, I cannot make out the European actors desire to appear in American movies, even second-rated at any cost. The fact puzzles me deeply. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in Hollywood. And out of what I saw with him, \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d is the best, beyond the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the worst \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d drawback is the way they speak Russian in the movie. I mean of course those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? Initially I set down to watch \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d just to listen to native German-speakers because I\xe2\x80\x99m studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. But it impressed me, made me cry when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to at all. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m 15 years late to watch it, but \xe2\x80\x9cStalingrad\xe2\x80\x9d is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.&#39;

b&#34;I think this is one hell of a movie...........We can see Steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all Segal movies there&#39;s a message in it, without the message it would be one of many action/fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special.&#34;

b&#39;This is one of my favorite &#34;Capra-esque&#34; comedies. This movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. It\&#39;s not religious commentary. It\&#39;s fun. It\&#39;s fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have described Travolta\&#39;s role (it\&#39;s the reason you\&#39;ll watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting cast (including Sparky!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&#39;

b&#34;I am a college student and I bought this movie at a used book store because it sounded really funny from the back description. Nothing would prepare me for what would be the FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is especially good to watch if you are an Atheist, like me. Because then you can see how silly these Christian people are. They seem to think non-believers like to live in really disgusting, messy houses and do nothing but drink beer and be mean to the neighbors. It&#39;s a LAUGH RIOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My buddies and I watch it every couple of weeks so that we may be entertained beyond our wildest imaginations! See this movie NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s hope Rich Christiano makes some more of these movies to entertain us heathens!&#34;

b&#39;Don\&#39;t Change Your Husband is, on the one hand, the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from Cecil B. DeMille. On the other it is his first picture to star Gloria Swanson, probably the greatest actress of the silent era, and is the film which made her a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the old DeMille formula was beginning to change, and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual, with such an expressive performer as Swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style. Her character does very little, but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression \xc2\x96 with a particular talent for looks of disdain. In real life Swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to Wallace Beery, and it\&#39;s possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if to best complement his leading lady\&#39;s talents, DeMille\&#39;s use of framing and close-ups is particularly strong here. He uses cinematic technique to show off the acting \xc2\x96 often holding Swanson in lengthy close-ups at key moments \xc2\x96 and also to clarify the story visually. For example, when we are introduced to the character of Toodles, she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror. Her character disappears from the story, only to become important towards the end. That attention-grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was. Later, at the anniversary dinner, Swanson and future husband number two Lew Cody are framed together in one shot, while Elliot Dexter is isolated in his own frame. Also \xc2\x96 and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general \xc2\x96 there is much use of reaction shots \xc2\x96 for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when Cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to DeMille\&#39;s visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator Jeanie Macpherson. As I\&#39;ve remarked in several other comments, Macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story, but like DeMille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style. And so we get these very long quasi-philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which, if they improve the story at all, it is only because they are unintentionally funny. For example, only Jeanie Macpherson could come up with a line like &#34;Fate sometimes lurks in Christmas shopping&#34;. Fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale, it is at this point that DeMille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular. You can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of Swanson being showered with &#34;Pleasure, wealth and love&#34;. It wouldn\&#39;t be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Don\&#39;t Change Your Husband is a fairly decent DeMille silent picture, although to be honest it is only really the presence Gloria Swanson that lifts it above the average. It\&#39;s curious though that this is supposedly a comedy, and Swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at Mack Sennett\&#39;s slapstick factory. She hated comedy acting, and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance. It makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with DeMille, Male and Female, was by far the strongest of their collaborations.&#39;

b&#34;After World War II the ungoing crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by the money from an Army base just across the river in Georgia, got even worse. Gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore. This movie is based on the real story of that fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the standards of the 1950&#39;s it was shockingly explicit. Although low-budget, that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting. A very gritty film. Richard Kiley was marvelous as always, and John McIntire stolid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this good movie isn&#39;t on video is a real puzzle!&#34;

b&#34;Normally, I do not review online, but it&#39;s Saturday and I&#39;m trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can&#39;t get the damned &#39;Joxer the Mighty&#39; song out of my head, it&#39;s been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like? If you expect more out of Bruce Campbell than what he puts out (in the most literal sense) than why in G-d&#39;s holy name do you watch his movies? No one watches a Bruce Campbell movie when they want to see something genius and intelligible, we watch them so we feel better about ourselves (like those people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey), and to be easily entertained by mindless psycho-babble. I, personally, love Bruce Campbell movies. I&#39;m not a complete idiot, in fact, I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar(haha, shut up, Ally). His movies reflect insane, random, quirky, ridiculous ideals which anyone with a brain, screaming or no, can enjoy. That, and he was kind of sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with the facial hair. I rate this movie an excellent 10, just because I can. If you can&#39;t take simplistic plot-schemes (if any), hot babes in sci-fi splendor(leather, spandex), and familiar if not exhausted views of insanity, then fer cryin&#39; out loud, don&#39;t watch the movie(or any that so much as mention the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yeah, Ted Raimi was awesome in this movie! Way to go Ted! You did the best with what you had. ;|&#34;

b&#39;This is one of those movies which get better with each viewing. I watched it three times and actually registered on IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. Movies &#34;about food&#34; have been done before, some of them are really good - as, for instance, a certain Japanese comedy which aficionados of Asian cinema will know anyway. But this one really is in its own league. At its core is a protestant Christian parable symbolizing the ideal of kindness but, far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the &#34;good&#34; in each and every of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is a pervading understatement and refinement in Babette\&#39;s Feast but this makes the message of the movie, if anything, stronger, not at all weaker. If you cannot attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you\&#39;re still welcome to this feast of the soul. Highly recommended!!&#39;

b&#39;Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist? Well, in certain doses, yes...and this film let out in a bit on ... &#34;how&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time I saw this so I focused more on the &#34;rich&#34; and &#34;famous&#34; part between the two. At the time, I had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there was...and how that would effect their friendship. Through their men, their career, the decades that defined them. And coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything else...their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got older, studied film a bit... and watched this film again with my best friend from High School. We do understand the \&#39;rich\&#39; and \&#39;famous\&#39; angle ... and we are still the best of friends...but this film is not a cinematic masterpiece...it can be seen as a bit campy at times...a little over the top at points (kinda on a \&#39;Dynasty\&#39; and \&#39;Dallas\&#39; level to me..) and honestly I can identify with the &#34;teddy bear&#34; scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men/careers, et al..so its not as over the top as it seems....! As many already said, seeing Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are great in this 1981 piece. this is a nice &#34;chick&#34; flick!&#39;

b&#39;This program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it MUST be released on DVD by seasons!!! The title of &#34;Promised Land&#34; is very apt, as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her! It\&#39;s a &#34;God Bless America&#34; type of program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery, and well-written humor and drama. It\&#39;s a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from--without worrying about bad language, &#34;adult&#34; themes, crudeness, violence, etc. We always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can\&#39;t wait to see each one all over again when they\&#39;re finally released on DVD!&#39;

b&#39;My 10/10 rating of course applies only if you\&#39;re willing to get completely and utterly grossed out*. Because you know that only John Waters can do that. In &#34;Pink Flamingos&#34; (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive. What Divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question. But even aside from that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine. You had better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are rather mind-blowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Otherwise, avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus!&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;m serious as well, I mean don\&#39;t get me wrong, if you haven\&#39;t got a bent for this type of Z grade, creaky creature feature {why would you be watching is my first thought?} then it\&#39;s a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops, but to me it\&#39;s a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood. You know the kind, the memories that never leave you. Eagerly taking it all in with youthful wonderment as Doug McClure and Peter Cushing tunnel beneath the mantle to do battle with a host of creatures and sub-human species\&#39;. And guys,! now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of Caroline Munro and her heaving cleavage. No wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes the effects are bad, men in suits, strings pinging parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like thingies amuse us greatly. And yes, Cushing and a surprisingly pudgy McClure act as if they have truly been mesmerised by the evil Meyhas at the &#34;core&#34; of our film. But it matters not, zany and clunky and awash in glorious colour, At The Earth\&#39;s Core is a throwback to a special pre-ILM time when kids like me queued around the block to see such joyous nonsense. 8/10&#39;

b&#34;I taped this on Sundance and had no idea that it was a Miike film. I thought it was just another kung fu movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw things like the dancing sax player &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;who sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew this had to be Miike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see Miike&#39;s credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far he hasn&#39;t disappointed me yet. Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good flicks, and now I&#39;ve found out that this was the third in a trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than Miike and Todd Solendz there&#39;s nobody making interesting films nowadays.&#34;

b&#34;I loved this movie. It&#39;s a lot of laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I&#39;d rather see a hundred movies like this than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeating and repeating themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a low budget affair and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a ten line minimum? I&#39;m not a critic, just a patron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino could write a picture this funny without filling it with masturbatory gratuitous violence. This movie should be seen on more screens than just one. I laughed from beginning to end. &gt;&#34;

b&#39;Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question Kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience. Three men are the focus of this chapter, and Kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad (In one\&#39;s case, almost overwhelmingly bad). With such vile characters, I found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment. However, when the time comes for the murder (And it\&#39;s subsequent effect on the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view, &#34;Are you not as guilty as this man?&#34; This sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of Dekalog Five that much more profound as Kieslowski (As usual) doesn\&#39;t stay within the literal confines of his theme. Just as the other parts of the Dekalog don\&#39;t take their Commandment\&#39;s theme in it\&#39;s literal sense, neither does Dekalog Five. It asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? It\&#39;s a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.&#39;

b&#39;After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial. The trick to the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite Dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brillant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My Grade: 10/10.&#39;

b&#39;forget the over-rated &#34;Batman Begins, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on. this movie has everything, and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office, but this is certainly a much better film. the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again. Gotham city, Batmans hunting ground, is an amazing sight to behold. the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts. Tim Burton and screenplay writer Daniel Walters go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. the Penguin, played to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him. very disgusting to watch at times, but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film. the other villain is Catwoman, played so absolutely brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a WOW performance, and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman villain\&#39;s is concerned. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina kyle, and she is a very put-upon, mousy secretary for a shrewd business man called Max Shreck, who later murders her by shoving her out a window. somehow, she survives and is &#34;awakened&#34; by cats, and decides right then and there to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and wrecks her entire apartment in one of the most Oscar worthy performance\&#39;s of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Keaton once again dons the cape and cowl as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time hes much darker. there\&#39;s not much else to say here except that Keaton is simply the best actor to play Batman ever. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he is very dark. he doesn\&#39;t talk a lot, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn\&#39;t make his voice sound all goofy and fake IE bales &#34;batman&#34; voice in batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he\&#39;s pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have to say though, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman gliding across Gotham, its the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, i rate this a 10, would give it more if i could.&#39;

b&#34;I rarely watch short films as they only seem to be on late night television and are not publicised enough for me to know which short films are worth while. As The Room is an extra feature on The Hitcher DVD, it gave me a wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with Rutger Hauer in excellent form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artistically shot in black and white, The Room explores a man&#39;s obsession with a room he passed by in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in a documentary/ interview style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with ramblings and occasional deficiencies in fluency. This adds great realism and depth to Hauer&#39;s performance who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hauer proves he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in the flashback scenes as young Harry with a silent role. He shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature length films. A very good effort.&#34;

b&#34;People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven&#39;t seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now. Someone needs to give this woman the credit she deserves. Same goes for Kelly Bishop who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. Also, it&#39;s nice to see a show that can have a young girl at the center of it, and not be filled with teen angst. Rory is a smart girl, which is also not seen a lot on television today. If only other shows could capture the wholeness of this show...&#34;

b&#34;If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won&#39;t bore you then this is the place. It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters. It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark. That image is burned in my mind forever. As an actor though he is pretty good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns. I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.&#34;

b&#39;So far Miguel Bardem\&#39;s career it\&#39;s been one of the more dreadful of recent Spanish cinema. He\&#39;s made nothing but rubbish... until now. &#34;Incautos&#34; has been quite a surprise: it\&#39;s a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The art of robbing, that\&#39;s what &#34;Incautos&#34; is about. A film much alike to David Mamet\&#39;s &#34;House of game&#34; and stuff like that. A thousand of twists in the script, and a story where nothing\&#39;s like it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weak points in latest Bardem\&#39;s movie may be the so-American language, that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural (especially Victoria Abril\&#39;s. She\&#39;s a hell of an actress, but in &#34;incautos&#34; she looks a little bit forced). Ernesto Alterio is not that bad, but he\&#39;s not half as good actor as his father... And what to say about Luppi?? Well, he\&#39;s the MAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: a good movie. The best that Miguel Bardem has ever made. I hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My rate: 7/10&#39;

b&#34;A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her evasive fianc\xc3\xa9. This is a much-maligned film because of its denouement, but up to that point, it&#39;s interesting, well-acted, eerie, and with fine set design (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and genteel, sort of a chic British Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who is hiding a family secret in his forbidding castle; there are even bats in the belfry! It moves leisurely until the final extraordinary set-piece, when Hurst and her aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle in the night to venture into the maze and find what they&#39;re looking for in its center. As a kid, I always remembered this sequence - there&#39;s nothing scarier (or claustrophobic) than not finding your way out of a 10-foot high maze of hedges. Naturally, the two women get separated, setting the stage for engrossing suspense with horrific music. The final result is mildly disappointing really, since Carlson&#39;s epilogue at the end makes some sense to all the goings-on, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing.&#34;

b&#34;I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. Whether you&#39;re a gore fan or a suspense fan; you&#39;ll love this. I used to dislike horror movies, considered them stupid. But, anyway, it happens I make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this film. Rarely have I ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but I tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck. Unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters. I highly recommend this film and I&#39;m glad that Asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend! Enjoy!&#34;

b&#39;The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (&#34;The Antichrist&#34;, &#34;The Killer is on the Phone&#34;) is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests\xc2\x85), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left &amp; right, outstanding music and \xc2\x96 last but not least \xc2\x96 a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy? When the anonymous man, dressed up like a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a flight of stairs, it really sent cold shivers through my spine! Years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to stimulate fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive-minded. She \xc2\x96 Joanna \xc2\x96 falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away. Naturally, he\&#39;s only after her money and starts terrorizing Joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that crippled her. The repeated images of a sinister looking priest, guided by eerie tunes and a nursery rhyme, provide &#34;Formula for a Murder&#34; with a ton of genuine scares and Alberto De Martino\&#39;s directing is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck (&#34;The Beyond&#34;, &#34;The Black Cat&#34;) in a glorious greedy villain role. Due some plot holes and a lack of originality, this movie might not be able to compete with Italy\&#39;s best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many formerly obscure and unknown Italian gialli received marvelous DVD-releases and, hopefully, &#34;Formula for a Murder&#34; will be given the same treatment really soon. In the meantime, good luck tracking this baby down!&#39;

b&#34;A gem of a British caper-comedy. Poor American schlub Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one) gets out of a British jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends, headed up by a really nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the lure of all that money is just too much for him. Things unravel and reravel and it&#39;s all joyous to watch. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same one twice - this one is just too lovable to hate. Niven never played a slicker bad guy, oil all over. Two fine actors we&#39;ve lost that I wish we had back.&#34;

b&#34;After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these. We are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feck&#39;s (Dennis Hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film. AMEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#39;I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how The Matrix was made. It is basically a huge commercial for The Matrix, a movie that the target audience of The Matrix Revisited has already seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of The Matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original DVD of The Matrix. There are things they show in those documentaries that I had not even realized had to be done or was done. The Matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a &#34;documentary&#34; that\&#39;s about as informative and interesting as an MTV special.&#39;

b&#39;i am working at a video store so i got to see this one for free- thank god, had i paid for it my review would be less forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, the major idea of the film (geeky girl takes bloody revenge) isn\&#39;t all that original, there are several parallels to &#34;carrie&#34; (playing a mean practical joke on a loser, except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her, tamaras and carries bad family background). i still think it\&#39;s a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn\&#39;t take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what worked: i liked the actress that played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her catty lines were fun (&#34;Sean can\&#39;t come to the phone. he\&#39;s f**king patrick!&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what didn\&#39;t work: the whole wicca thing was silly. i generally prefer rational explanations (she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge). there were a lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue- please!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the whole idea wasn\&#39;t bound for Oscar buzz, but i just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had. it was bearable but far from good!&#39;

b&#34;This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening&#39;s viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies. It was all downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer&#39;s choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David. Dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one time when Hollywood knew more than jolly old England.&#34;

b&#34;Some films are so badly made they are watchable purely for the cringe factor. Disciples made me cringe so much it was uncomfortable. I watched it all disbelieving what I was watching, wasn&#39;t anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming? Mix the most hammed performances from the most wooden actors, an abysmal script were every comment from all of the &#39;actors&#39; sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried (and failed bigtime) to give the film a forced pace. All these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return. Avoid at EVERY cost.&#34;

b&#39;Yes, that\&#39;s true. That movie is a horrible piece of... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski\&#39;s books in Poland think the same. The truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films. It\&#39;s a shame when you compare &#34;Wiedzmin&#34; and &#34;Conan the Barbarian&#34; for example. I hope no one outside Poland will ever see this nightmare.&#39;

b&#39;Cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term &#34;video nasties&#34;. This was a notorious British list containing all the films that could bring \&#39;damage\&#39; to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies (Faces of Death, Cannibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror films (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders). Keeping this in mind, it\&#39;s quite unusual to see &#34;Night of the Bloody Apes&#34; listed among the other &#34;nasties&#34;. It sure is gory\xc2\x85but the blood and violence are so poorly presented I can\&#39;t imagine anyone would be offended by it. And the silly plot (about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla\&#39;s heart into the chest of his dying son) isn\&#39;t exactly what you would call disturbingly real, neither. All that remains is a fairly amusing pulp-horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze. The man-ape make up effects are laughable and there\&#39;s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere. Enjoyable only if you\&#39;re in the right mood, in other words. The few sequences showing detailed matches of lady-wrestling (which one of the lead-actresses does for a living) are very cool.&#39;

b&#39;I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. My friends and I are fans of HK film, but WOW. This movie has it all, and by all I mean everything a movie shouldn\&#39;t have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, way over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, unfunny &#34;gags&#34; and &#34;jokes&#34;, elementary school premise, mindless killings, and too-long running time for the material. Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you\&#39;re entertaining the idea of watching this film...don\&#39;t.&#39;

b&#34;This is slightly less sickening than the first two films, but otherwise it&#39;s business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. Charles Bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. Crime, you see, is up 11% in the South Belmont area... so what&#39;s to be done? A stronger police presence? Tougher jails? Harsher sentences? Nope, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like Bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge \xc2\x96 or, as the writers would have it, justice: this time he&#39;s the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writers bend over backwards to make Kersey the hero, sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection, and supplying a scene in which Kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back, to applause from the watching crowd. Capital punishment for theft? Well, okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer Kersey on or back him up is appalling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn&#39;t the film leave the audience to make up its mind, rather than slanting the entire thing towards Kersey and his mindless answer? Funnily enough the beleaguered residents don&#39;t fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of Kersey&#39;s involvement. At the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre, never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atrociously shallow performances don&#39;t help \xc2\x96 Bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can&#39;t even put inflection on the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here \xc2\x96 a machine gun? A rocket launcher?! \xc2\x96 and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dreck, pure and simple, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.&#34;

b&#39;This is just about one of the dumbest things I\&#39;ve ever seen. Maybe not a worst movie ever contender, but if you haven\&#39;t seen that many bad ones, this could easily make your Top Ten Worst List. When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original &#34;King Kong&#34;, you\&#39;ve got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. Then, taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to &#34;Star Wars&#34; the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment, this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me ask you, what would possess the Professor (Peter Cushing) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth\&#39;s core? OK, so it was useful in fending off the parrot/tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) in the early going, but come on. Somehow I don\&#39;t think this is what Edgar Rice Burrough\&#39;s had in mind when he wrote his tales of Pellucidar. He probably didn\&#39;t have Caroline Munro in mind either as Princess Dia, probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least there was one bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that I got a kick out of; I\&#39;m always looking for one in films like this. That would have to be how the sky at the earth\&#39;s core was really the underside of the earth\&#39;s crust, explaining that ethereal pinkish glow. But try as it might, the story just couldn\&#39;t hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about Hoojah the Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less those goofy half man, half pterodactyl creatures. To paraphrase the good professor - &#34;You cannot mesmerize me, I\&#39;m paying attention!&#34;&#39;

b&#39;I liked the first The Grudge. It really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice. That something was missing from this sequel. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really sticks to your mind. It\&#39;s people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. And most of the time, it wasn\&#39;t even all that scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot-wise this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she was given nothing to do, and Karen\&#39;s death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly. I was also disappointed in the Kayako\&#39;s mother subplot. I was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the Grudge, but she dies in the hands - hair? - of Kayako. That was such a stupid twist. All in all, it\&#39;s difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die. All in the same way. And there\&#39;s nothing they can do. It doesn\&#39;t feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them. It\&#39;s just boring, because you know what\&#39;s going to happen. If they had anything to fight it with, that would have added suspense, even if they failed. If there was any hope, it would make the scares more justified. Now you\&#39;re just waiting for them to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it. I was still scared during some scenes, but I actually got used to the huge eye and blue face. The makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts. Yes, I was scared at the school psychologist scene - even if I knew where it was going as soon as she said &#34;I\&#39;ve been to the house&#34;. A nice touch. Toshio, however, was not scary at all in this movie. I was much more creeped out by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the notorious milk-scene with the girl whose name I can\&#39;t even remember comes to mind. I wasn\&#39;t scared, it was just &#34;Huh?&#34; I\&#39;m not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed. Karen could have brought the grudge to the US with her. It could have killed people related to her life, everyone at the funeral, or something like that. Even so, it would have been dull to watch them all die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying. Hated the &#34;I won\&#39;t call you mother&#34; scene. Aubrey\&#39;s mother issues were equally dull. The little boy was a touching character, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ju-On sequel was much scarier than this one. It had some new twists - dreams and reality blurring much more, for instance - and even if it left me feeling quite down, I was also somehow satisfied. I got to think a bit and be left wondering. This movie only provided cheap scares.&#39;

b&#34;Man, the &#39;90&#39;s really were an horrible decade for movies. The movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 6th entry into the long running Halloween-series is certainly a bad one. You just never really get into the story because it isn&#39;t a very well constructed and build-up movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s simply a poorly done film, that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. It&#39;s a real shame that this had to be Donald Pleasence last film-role. It&#39;s nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an Halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers just never comes across as threatening or scary. Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s featured too prominently throughout the movie, from pretty early on already. He does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. Also the attempts to uncover Myer&#39;s past don&#39;t really work out, for the main reason that it just doesn&#39;t get explained very well. It&#39;s obvious that the script went through various re-writes before- and also very possibly during filming. Several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie more often looks and feels like a made for TV one. This is also due to the lack of some real good gore. As an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the worst out of the series!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#34;

b&#39;Am I the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? I knew nothing about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and would not have done so if I had known that most of his previous films were horror films. I am not into that at all, I was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on TV, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that I read.&#39;

b&#39;Ladies and Gentlemen, may we present the worst of all Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is &#34;That Darn Cat&#34;, it should have been &#34;That Darn Teen&#34; or &#34;FBI Agent&#34;. The cat didn\&#39;t get any real good scenes, Ricci\&#39;s character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug didn\&#39;t get any good lines, even Dean Jones\&#39;s cameo role couldn\&#39;t save this movie! The only really good characters were the town\&#39;s only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were only brief. In all, I\&#39;d say that if you are considering watching this movie, go get something more intelligent like a Barney video.&#39;

b&#39;This movie was really bad, plain and simple. How a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a decent idea, but it just didn\&#39;t flesh out. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s get down to the big issue here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The visuals were so incredibly bad, I thought I was watching an old &#34;Dinosaurs In 3D&#34; CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean, I\&#39;ve seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean, heck... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lizard-monkeys were laughable. I thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from &#34;Killer Instinct&#34; I\&#39;ve seen better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, there\&#39;s a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channels &#34;The Shining&#34; get such a small audience, but this load of &#34;CGI, easy to make 4 Kidz&#34; gets put out in the open? I don\&#39;t care if it\&#39;s a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee&#39;

b&#39;They did it again: ripped off an old show\&#39;s title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring &#34;re-imagined&#34; stuff. The \&#39;60\&#39;s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. The character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; that\&#39;s about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who\&#39;s even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Poor scripting. A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice Underdog is painful. You\&#39;d think they\&#39;d at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate Wally Cox\&#39;s humorously distinctive voice for Underdog. But no. There are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. Everybody else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Watch this only in desperation.&#39;

b&#34;This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I watched the manga review in a magazine, I thought it was maybe interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series have an standard. But as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical based upon the Christian mythologies, but it&#39;s a total stupidity. It features some demons and stigmata scenes... Totally nonsense. It seems the series tries to seem deeply-thought, complex or mythologically reviewed, but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references, will realize soon all those elements used don&#39;t have a real sense: THEY ARE PUT THERE ONLY TO IMPRESS THE IGNORANT WATCHERS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements: battles with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed fight between demons, and demons who controls time (with no apparent reason). The final is totally nonsense; an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: THE FINAL AND THE COMPLETE SERIES IS A TOTAL INCOHERENT AND INCONGRUENT NONSENSE.&#34;

b&#39;OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane but you\&#39;ve got to love a movie where the women are always topless. There are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. On the other hand I hope they didn\&#39;t overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here\&#39;s a prime example. After one of the captive girls dies: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died&#34; &#34;A relative?&#34; &#34;No, my favorite cow.&#34; I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I guess that\&#39;s what happens after a while when everything looks the same.

If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins cant fly! Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. I am not who you think I am!&#34;

b&#34;It&#39;s a shame that someone so idolised by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative, bandwagon-jumping tripe. I often wonder if Mr Wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride. At least Sally Geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish. A cameo by some long forgotten pop called the Pretty Things cannot rescue the film from it&#39;s awfulness. If you want 60&#39;s nostalgia invest in &#39;Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush&#39; instead, starring Barry Evans and Sally&#39;s sister Judy instead.&#34;

b&#34;( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It&#39;s amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Reshamiya. It&#39;s amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? Sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunders rule. ( Ex. How can German Police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in English? They communicate among themselves in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line Bollywood. There are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. The worse thing is that the majority just doesn&#39;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Songs are the only saving grace...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#39;t repeat this HR and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. No problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it&#39;s a 50Cr movie.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m seeing a pattern here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are if you go to IMDb.com there will be hordes of lovers of the film, yet it was picked to be on that TV show because it was sooo bad. I\&#39;m sorry but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism. Well if that is the case I could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950\&#39;s knowledge this movie is utterly flawed. Gravity might be the first obvious observation, or as MST3K did as a skit &#34;selective gravity&#34;, also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window, um would\&#39;nt the ship being upside down effect that scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but I think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type. Just compare this to &#34;When Worlds Collide&#34; which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks, there\&#39;s no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, its not even funny to watch on its own. It gets about a 5 or 6 as a MST3K episode as there is no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh did I mention, it\&#39;s bad.&#39;

b&#34;CRAP! I accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003. I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it. Shame on whoever gave this junk an award. I thoroughly loathed this film-in fact I didn&#39;t see it through to the end. After an hour I could no longer stand it. I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BA-AD acting. PAINFUL. I rate it 1 star out of 10. An amateur could make a much, much greater movie.&#34;

b&#39;This Harold Lloyd short wasn\&#39;t really much; not one of his funnier efforts. Of course, I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. That\&#39;s what the bulk of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house. Half the time it\&#39;s the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another Lloyd short, &#34;Haunted Spooks.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the good ending doesn\&#39;t save the whole picture, which I probably wouldn\&#39;t watch again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It just isn\&#39;t that funny.&#39;

b&#39;OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he\&#39;s bringing aboard a live animal -&#34;no really, it\&#39;s research equipment, the air holes are just an accident&#34;). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there\&#39;s something to steal. Once the WOOD CRATE is open, the Chupacabra breaks through the STEEL BARS inside and goes on a killing rampage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a stroke of sheer coincidence, a Marshall (I assume a U.S. Marshall, since he was in the gulf war, not just some guy named Marshall) is on board, investigating some money that went missing from the ship\&#39;s safe. He\&#39;s posing as an insurance salesman (&#34;Lady, I\&#39;m the best insurance you\&#39;ve got...&#34;). Other scintillating characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (snicker - Tae-bo), an annoying old stuck-up lady with a tiny dog which should be fed to a cat (guess WHAT eats it...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo who might have been believable in a movie made in 1964, not in anything more recent. Much of the acting was really bad, and the characters were just there so that you can laugh hysterically when they died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What??? Bullets don\&#39;t even make Chupacabra flinch, but the Tae-bo bimbo can punch him and scare him away???? Hey Sci-fi Channel, you desperate for scripts or what?&#39;

b&#39;My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie &#34;Babas bilar&#34; must be just about the worst film I ever seen. I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper. Put to practice both script and the cast fails to deliver. There are to much action, it happens to much things and you can\&#39;t help wonder why it happens. And then the cast, the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start to cry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have to much time at hand I would say you can see it. If not - don\&#39;t.&#39;

b&#34;I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch&#39;s secretary) is one of the only good things about this film. She is my favorite actress ever, every role she plays is always done so well. Her character is sly, sarcastic, clever, light hearted, funny and cunning. She really pulls this role off well and you get a good feel for what her character is all about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the movie is pretty bad. The music is the most entertaining thing left. One of the characters has this really strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears her tight zebra striped tank top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea that someone hires these three college-aged kids to spruce up an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says - go at it. That would be really fun and I wish someone would give me that chance! Imagine going into an old abandoned theater with two other people and you get to decide how to decorate it, and fix it up. You have total control over the whole building. That would be so fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not think of this as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a big chore. They walk around with long faces and fight with each other the whole time. It&#39;s kind of a bummer. But it&#39;s fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren&#39;t even excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie does a pretty good job at making you feel helpless or a little spooked out by the theater itself. However, the acting (besides Woronov.. and possibly Murdoch, the boss - just because makes a really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has any luck) is really horrible and you just end up feeling unsatisfied. Plus, the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruins the reality that the film tries to create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this if you dig Mary Woronov, funky 80&#39;s Casio keyboard style electronic beats and if you think having a giant spooky abandoned theater to yourself is at all intriguing.&#34;

b&#39;Simply miserable Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza vehicle. Pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of &#34;The Student Prince&#34; with adults. Pinza is no leading man either. He looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds are given so little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our King Ezio had better return to his people. As far as I\&#39;m concerned, the faster the better. Is that Lana Turner really singing with Pinza? Not bad if it is her. The picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34; with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.&#39;

b&#39;First of all, the genre of this movie isn\&#39;t comedy, it\&#39;s more of a drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had low expectations on the movie, and still they didn\&#39;t come up them. As some of the other reviews point out, there are some nice music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi, or M\xc3\xb6tley Crue, it\&#39;ll be more quality time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock\&#39;n\&#39;roll genre, I recommend &#34;Almost Famous&#34;.&#39;

b&#34;The Untold... Is one of the worst films I ever saw. The story really seems original, but it was badly bestow on screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. But, hey he made a lot of low budget films... you need to pay the bills, you know? Kidding. Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just to have a nudity scene, and other actors... well they were just there. There was constantly a fade out-fade in editing, and that makes me sick! That was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre tempo that goes just... wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#39;t say more... don&#39;t rent it, or buy it. You can watch it, if on TV.&#34;

b&#34;Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere. It was well shot, but, then again, it is a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a chick flick. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing I didn&#39;t know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want that, watch National geographic. I love Lane, but I&#39;ve never seen her in a movie this lousy. As far as Gere goes, he&#39;s a good actor, but he had movies like this, so I&#39;m not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.&#34;

b&#39;Watching QUINTET is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese, or some other language you do not understand. You get the idea that they are playing a game, and if you watch closely enough, you may just begin to understand the rules. But, why bother, since it is clear you can\&#39;t join in and you wouldn\&#39;t want to if you had the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Robert Altman is not one to beg an audience to like his films, let alone understand them. Sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd, like in M*A*S*H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, films so full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two more bodies in the scene wouldn\&#39;t make much of a difference. And other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone might even be watching his film; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to purposely dare anyone to become involved with the narrative. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can\&#39;t depend on Altman to do the logical or the expected, which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes doing the unexpected isn\&#39;t daring, just dumb. For instance, in QUINTET, we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of getting pregnant, and she is, indeed, with child. This last ray of hope in a decaying society is almost immediately extinguished; Altman doesn\&#39;t even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right off the bat. Brave? Maybe. Stupid? Definitely. Devoid of a purpose, he tries to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg, all the while reminding us how pointless the effort is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, QUINTET, can at least claim to be prophetic. The story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various bored characters. It is a form of TAG (the assassination game): a handful of people target each other for elimination, each as a would-be assassin and each as a would-be victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third. As they die off, new targets are assigned. Whoever lives, wins. All of this happens at some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. It is, to a great extent, an extreme, sci-fi version of &#34;Survivor&#34; -- minus the commercial plugs and faked &#34;reality.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a bad concept for a sci-fi epic. A post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm of the world (the cast is pointedly multinational), a game where no on can be trusted or least not for long, and where no one really wins. Literally a cold war. A steely eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day. The mystery in QUINTET is not in the game or how it is played, but in why it exists it all. If the game &#34;Quintet&#34; is a metaphor for life, then Altman, seems to see nothing in the material but a chance to show life to be an empty, meaningless game -- a conclusion as obvious as it is untrue. Given the lively, albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films, I don\&#39;t believe that Altman believes in QUINTET either. And if Altman has no faith in his material, why should we?&#39;

b&#34;I made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci-fi film--one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, while I was looking forward to either bug-eyed aliens or power-mad conquerers, the aliens in this film were a MAJOR disappointment! First, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and he looked pretty ordinary) and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship! Second, the alien was neither the evil conquerer or the benevolent friend of mankind--but a real odd-ball. And finally, the plot itself seemed so dumb, preachy and heavy-handed that it elicited more yawns than thrills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the USA) are kidnapped by an alien. The alien gives each of them devices by which they CAN destroy all life on the planet if they so choose--because, the alien admits that HIS race of people would love to inhabit the Earth but they themselves won&#39;t kill to get it. Then, he returns them all. While it&#39;s 100% obvious that no one would WANT to use these devices, the alien then announces on TV the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are THAT powerful! So, all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works--as the Soviets want to use it!!! This part of the film just seemed pretty silly. Sure the USSR was an evil and corrupt nation (sorry, but it&#39;s fact--especially under Stalin), they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist), somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the EVIL people who hate freedom. So, he uses it to wipe out all the evil Commies and presumably others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise!! Preachy, silly and full of plot holes--this movie just isn&#39;t worth your time, though it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses Communism--in particular, the tensions between Nato and the Soviets.&#34;

Why? 1)The premise is WELL beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing doesn\&#39;t even have legs to move on! 3) It escapes AFTER being completely submerged in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this...It travels all the way across an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) &#34;Killer Snowballs&#34;. I have yet to be drunk enough to see &#34;Ginger Dead Man&#34; so as of the writing of this, Jack Frost 2 hold the distinction of being THE stupidest &#34;horror&#34; film ever.

b&#39;Red spectacles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved Avalon, I think This director has made some awesome demented visions of the future. This film however was boring pretentious crap. The opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action amimae style future noir. I feel I got that with Avalon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Red Spectacles I was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was. The film barely made sense to me and I could not care less about the people in it. This would all be ok if the film was effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot-suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, it did not watch the film worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down.&#39;

b&#34;Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK what about the plot outline? It is a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meet an useless, skill-less, loafer who aspires to be an actor tale. The story is so short that if just another sentence, IMDb might ban me for writing a spoiler. About the story-telling? Its like a bunch (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Don&#39;t try this movie if you have bought new DVD-player. You would end up believing that either DVD is in bad shape or DVD-player is struck. Not its fault at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) can&#39;t speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. So, you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those Antra-malli song sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do watch this movie if you are new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to see any Bollywood movie and enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There can&#39;t be worse 3 hour torture than this!&#34;

b&#34;STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tale of the titular Adam (Mark O&#39; Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day. Along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they&#39;ve managed to let down and destroy over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of Irish people like to drink, but it seems some of them have problems with heroin, too by the looks of this movie. I know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, like there is in many parts of the world, so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t recall the last Irish movie I saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film I&#39;ve seen lately!) And, judging from that, obviously I&#39;m not as enlightened on their humour as I could be. The film is rather funny in certain parts, but it&#39;s obviously another comedy that isn&#39;t afraid to raise near-the-knuckle laughs. The scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and I&#39;m not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn&#39;t put a smile on my face! It&#39;s also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they&#39;re seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to-and-fro. In light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I just failed to see the point to the film. I didn&#39;t see any motivation in the &#39;story&#39; it was telling. It just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) it&#39;s an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it&#39;s very short 83 minute running time. Really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day. **&#34;

b&#39;A tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. As action opens, Reno (A.J. Buckley) enters his apartment, there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who gloatingly tells Reno &#34;Well, at least it\&#39;s with someone you know&#34;, resulting in Reno\&#39;s decision to never have another roommate, this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice-over. The storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that Reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates, although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom he has generated marital plans. The plot briefly shifts to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, wherein Reno\&#39;s Uncle Charley, enamoured of a &#34;dancer&#34; whom he finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club\&#39;s bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections. It is apparent that Charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart, because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to his vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with he and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan. Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of Reno. Direction is slack, plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work, and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat. As a result, the performances are undistinguished, not aided by spotty editing, while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly\&#39;s tail light. Filmed with a low budget and on location, only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes, but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack, generally blaring and nearly always invasive. A good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie\&#39;s final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before, but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay, and bids fair to make the work almost watchable, despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.&#39;

b&#39;Everything about this movie is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can\&#39;t however, gauge how bad it\&#39;s going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn\&#39;t provoke the slightest emotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups. The wogs always win of course, because they apparently lift weights and have &#34;respect&#34;. It is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripting and hatred for the people who funded this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison. The entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what I assume is the plot, and consists of a bunch of fights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once out of prison(3 years for murder?) The main character and his mate reunite with the wogs. They then go to the &#34;other side of town&#34; and try to lay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soon the wogs get set up for the rape of another gang members girl , and run around town fighting off hordes of different gangs. This point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as the wogs simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they\&#39;ve fought so far. Apparently the other gangs don\&#39;t have a problem uniting to take on the remaining wogs(the skinheads don\&#39;t mind Asians). After about a million more people get beaten up by the invincible wog brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home. They don\&#39;t make it home however, because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie may be more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also tonnes more stupid unexplainable events in this movie, such as an Asian fighting off his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the wogs get away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else mentioned, this movie isn\&#39;t so bad its funny, it\&#39;s just so bad.&#39;

b&#34;I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case I&#39;ll make an exception.The first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks. This is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him. The lead actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn&#39;t even save this movie. Sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great..this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest...don&#39;t choose this one..save your money.&#34;

b&#34;That&#39;s what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick. We couldn&#39;t believe how stupid it was! I think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up. Well, I guess the joke is on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten, every single one says this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and on and on. And boy are they right! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can&#39;t believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear this had to be made in the 70&#39;s before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy, but when I looked on here it said it was made in 2001? What? It sure doesn&#39;t look like a movie that would be made today, but I guess that&#39;s what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers, and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens, we couldn&#39;t tell!) were so fugly, even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn&#39;t touch them with a 50-foot pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#39;s absolutely no appeal to this movie at all, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don&#39;t waste your time or money on this one, you&#39;ll be completely disappointed!&#34;

b&#34;Predictable, gory, over-gimmicky, mediocre. Don&#39;t waste your time - there are many much better movies out there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resurrection starts out OK but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My interest level fell off steadily. By the end of the movie I was just glad it was finally over. The characters never fully developed. The cinematography is muddy and the quick change POV rotations - while impressive in 1999 perhaps, presently merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee whiz flash for plot and character substance. The film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose (convey tension and anxiety) but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive. A shame overall - the film/story obviously had potential and the producers/directors and actors obviously have technical skill. A disappointment.&#34;

b&#39;This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. Really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get clich\xc3\xa9 snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone &#34;tough guy&#34; persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete American Tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. Otherwise it\&#39;s standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.&#39;

b&#34;The film is somewhat entertaining, but the greatest feature is Shalom Harlow&#39;s laughable performance. It has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully Harlow has gone through more training. Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly, somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.&#34;

b&#39;I remembered this awful movie I bought at Camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when I was visiting my Grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror/gore genre had to offer.... or so I thought! I was only about 12 years old at the time so I really don\&#39;t remember it all that well. I remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (I think) who were riding in a car that wasn\&#39;t actually moving, but being rocked side to side to look like it was... true cinemagic. I also remember it being the worst film I had ever seen up to that point and I promptly threw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something tonight made me think of that movie (I can\&#39;t believe I actually remembered the name), so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise... IT WAS! And a full other 5 people have seen it.... Amazing. Even though I remember hating the film at the time I sort of wish I had kept it hidden away somewhere because I\&#39;d love to check it out again for a laugh (it would probably make a good drinking game movie). Anyway, I\&#39;m glad I\&#39;m part of the elite few that\&#39;s seen this little &#34;treasure&#34;. I would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks.... but beware, this is not a recommendation... it is awful... it\&#39;s just for nostalgia.&#39;

b&#34;Hmmm, not a patch on the original from Shaw Brothers. The fighting is average and looks very clunky. The story line is as to be expected from a 70&#39;s Kung Fu film, confusing and daft. Stupid voices for women,dubbed in posh English accents for men. i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks. Get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don&#39;t be fooled, i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the Shaw brothers movie. i have just started commenting, I&#39;m only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection, i personally own most modern martial arts flicks. Hope you don&#39;t waste time watching this one, its for die hard fans of 70&#39;s Kung Fu only.&#34;

b&#34;After reading other reviews on this site, we weren&#39;t sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didn&#39;t sound bad enough. However, 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were in for another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this movie served up a melted, sour, broken-bottomed ice cream cone (you know, the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet-nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? It appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood. That&#39;s it. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the qualifications for becoming an ice-cream man in this crap town? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers, and oversized syringes to the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away. 3. Make sure your truck is stocked with severed body parts, roaches, and don&#39;t forget the eye whites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors in this movie are pure B-Movie caliber. Mixed in with a bunch of unknowns is, who other than....a trailer-trash version of Macaulay Culkin!! Even his bratty charm couldn&#39;t save this kick in the pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie reeked! Who would kill an ice cream man in a drive-by shooting? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from Hollywood. Did they honestly think a pillow under a kid&#39;s shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat? Did they forget about the arms, face, legs, and all other body parts? Second of all, this movie was made in 1995, yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80&#39;s movie, evidenced by the big brother&#39;s white, crotch-hugging high-water pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we were watching this shotty production, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly. At many points it the movie, we found that staring at a blank wall behind the T.V. set was more entertaining than the actual movie. We were stunned that this movie didn&#39;t make it to the Bottom 100. Afterwards, we took the tape out of the VCR and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard ice cream cone.&#34;

b&#34;No Holds Barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. Look at it more in the way that you should Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that aren&#39;t supposed to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as only he can play them) grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see. It might be the funniest scene ever, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money I&#39;ll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission. I hope they at least got fired. This movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts.&#34;

b&#39;This has to be one of the WORST movies I have seen. I tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film! Cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough story to pull you in, no action apart from some REALLY cheap scenes. It seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other &#34;hey this looks rather cool, why not put this in there&#34; after which the director probably said &#34;Yeah....YEAH this is genius!&#34; and got back to snorting coke or something. When it comes to acting I think the only person that TRIED to make the movie worked is Daan Schuurmans but in the end it is all for nothing. Cause this movie SUCKS!! 2/10&#39;

b&#34;This was a very nice concert by the one and only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The vocals were okay. i have to admit that his vocals were crap on Human Nature and Billie Jean. You couldn&#39;t hear him half the time. The other songs make up for the singing. The Highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I Just Can&#39;t Stop Loving You She&#39;s Out Of My Life Thriller Billie Jean (The Dancing Not The Singing) Black or White Man in the Mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it was anybody but Mj it would have been a 9. It is a must see. I wish I was born then so I could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992.&#34;

b&#34;I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had high hopes watching this last night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid reviews until I watch something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake! My 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.Once it moved into TV &#39;reality show&#39; territory it stank to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay TV writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of &#39;Memento&#39; - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.&#34;

b&#34;I tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn&#39;t sit well with me. Although the performances are good, the writing isn&#39;t. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we&#39;re supposed to side with Casey, given that she&#39;s the protagonist, but I don&#39;t find her at all likable. The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable. The plot lines are a bit far-fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow -- blended families are common, yes, but this family isn&#39;t really trying all that hard to blend. On the whole, I think it grades thumbs-down.&#34;

b&#39;Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world\&#39;s second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. &#34;K2&#34; is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing. During one of their trips, they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne\&#39;s team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so. During their training run, however, two of Claibourne\&#39;s team get themselves killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold put themselves forward as potential replacements. Despite initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the Himalayas. Harold\&#39;s wife Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul) is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb, especially since he has recently become a father. Tensions in the climbing team mount as Taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group, the equally brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body. Will the guys reach the peak of K2, or is their quest destined to end in disappointment, or even death?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;K2&#34; spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters. Biehn as a foul-mouthed, pushy, adventurous type is especially hard to like, as is Barry as the hard-nosed mountaineering millionaire. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb K2 - heck, she\&#39;d be better off if he never came back!! Rounding off the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterisation as Dallas Woolf is as campy and over-the-top as every other role he\&#39;s ever played. The story itself is totally tame and disposable \xc2\x96 just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain. There\&#39;s a bit of male bonding thrown in, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife amounts to nil, and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas ring totally false. &#34;K2&#34; scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by Gabriel Berastain \xc2\x96 during the Himalayan sequences, the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured. I\&#39;m completely with critic Kim Newman on this one, who hilariously stated in Empire magazine: &#34;On this evidence, climbing K2 can\&#39;t be any harder than sitting through it!&#34; Quite true, Kim, quite true!&#39;

b&#34;I would have given this movie a 1, but I laughed so hard, so many times, that I had to give it a little credit, in the off off off off chance the film was Supposed to be funny. A movie so bad you&#39;ll think chimps wrote it. You&#39;ll wish chimps had written it. Dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. The movie Exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the Original Carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. Like intersplicing scenes from Taxi Driver into Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone, as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. Worst actress of the Millenium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the stone-faced, monotone, disastrously wooden school counselor. Worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3&#34;

b&#34;All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who don&#39;t care about this, but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public, as evidenced in comments here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is an interesting premise, which isn&#39;t original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film, yet done with gusto. What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility, professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#39;t nearly as bad as many here think, and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans. However, it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout, and is close to on par with a Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $2 (or less) as did I, you won&#39;t feel disappointed, but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.&#34;

b&#34;Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off from the movie Amadeus. I personally rate Amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life-time, but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people, particularly Saliere, the Italian composer, who was jealous of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka.., as the director has invariably cut-pasted most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies Bollywood keeps on churning day by day. The movie is a disaster, the two musicians in the movie don&#39;t give you any feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, meaningless and total failure on every count. The only person who makes an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie, because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended. I wish I could take Darshan and Co. to court not only for Copyright Infringement, but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art.&#34;

b&#39;I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering &#34;The Dain Curse&#34;. My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film &#34;The Molly Maguires&#34;). I reported the \&#39;action\&#39; in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment to me. As an aside, I appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to &#34;jump in&#34; and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white stills I took of the production work for the newspaper. Someday, they may be of interest to film/television historians.--Lou Varricchio&#39;

b&#39;Native Chief\&#39;s son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father. The evil Witch Doctor orders to execute him. He then comes back as a murdering tree(!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a &#34;film&#34;? If it was intended to be a horror film, there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved. And for a comedy, it still isn\&#39;t funny enough. I don\&#39;t know why people make films like this. I guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it. Or you might want to see the incredible &#34;monstrous&#34; tree, which gives a new dimension to &#34;a slow death&#34;. Or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved.

b&#34;What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. One of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and I&#39;m talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it&#39;s obvious she&#39;s just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor Peter Coyote lives in. Fairuza Balk is photographed poorly, to boot. She looks like an overweight freshman who&#39;s pigged out at too many all-you-can-eat-student-cafeteria-buffets. I was so looking forward to this film. I WANTED to like it, but I think I&#39;d rather watch Nastassja read the phone book, with her OWN hair.&#34;

b&#39;James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed &#34;Patsy&#34;!), a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. Tepid genre entry wherein Cagney\&#39;s the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there\&#39;s not much else of interest going on. Jimmy gives just what\&#39;s expected from his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfying if you\&#39;re in for a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, though Michael Curtiz was said to have helped) is straightforward without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slips in the second-half, grinding the film down to a messy conclusion (with even Cagney\&#39;s Patsy getting lost in the shuffle). Remade in 1938 as &#34;Crime School&#34; and again in 1939 as &#34;Hell\&#39;s Kitchen&#34;. ** from ****&#39;

b&#39;I once had a conversation with my parents who told me British cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film\&#39;s country of origin before going to see it . It didn\&#39;t matter what the plot was or who was in it , if it was an American movie people would want to see it and if it was British people wouldn\&#39;t want to see it . This might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing THE ASTONISHED HEART I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema to the home grown variety Back in the 1940s &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;British equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie . Everyone speaks in an English lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the British Royal Family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential British audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have , If not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class English shrink in 1949 . That\&#39;s entertainment , the reason people go to cinemas . Even the characters names seem bizarre - Leonora ! How many British people were named Leonora in 1949 ? And the protagonists drink cocktails . And they use words like &#34; Austere &#34; . You do get the feeling that this wasn\&#39;t marketed for a 1949 mainstream British audience . But why should it if the majority of British cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining American imports ? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching THE ATSONISHED HEART in 2005 I was astonished how dated everything was , in fact it\&#39;s so dated I thought maybe it might be a spoof from THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW . What didn\&#39;t astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the British film industry , an industry that didn\&#39;t pick up until American money invested in crowd pleasers like ZULU , ALFIE and the James Bond movies&#39;

b&#39;Am I the only one to notice that the &#34;realism&#34; of the 19th century ship is erroneous. Actually it\&#39;s a 15th century, right around 1620 if memory serves me, because the &#34;realistic&#34; ship in the movie is the Mayflower, now as far as I know the Mayflower NEVER went to Australia or even attempted a voyage to Australia. I don\&#39;t know who handled R&amp;D for this film, but using the Mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even printed it on the cover art and the DVD.

b&#34;Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year, until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis , maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens. The ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only for real Ted&#39;s fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab&#34;

b&#39;I saw this film in a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the attendees were from the local private school at which I was teaching. I had seen a few Godard films previously while I lived in France, and, though they hadn\&#39;t been my favorites, I could at least make sense of them. Being able to speak French helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fairly innocuous beginning of &#34;Le week-end&#34; soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, maybe too well photographed, that soon made no sense to me. For me, films, like books, must have some clear sort of meaning. This didn\&#39;t for me. I suppose I\&#39;m not &#34;into&#34; artsy films. Images still haunt me from the film. To this day I refuse to eat rabbit meat, well-loved by the French. Those who\&#39;ve seen the film might realize why. Yes, the theme of materialism came through, but the cannibalism, the car wrecks, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me. I\&#39;m not sure if I walked out before the end, but I certainly felt like it. I promised myself that I\&#39;d never watch another Godard film, and I haven\&#39;t and never knowingly will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting film I\&#39;ve ever seen. Others may have been more inept, silly or stupid. I\&#39;ve forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever.&#39;

b&#39;This is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just wacky), to keep trying, maybe taking some classes, and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. (&#34;Dude, Where\&#39;s My Car&#34; and the &#34;Scary Movie&#34; sequence have it all over this ... college attempt.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighting wasn\&#39;t; the production wasn\&#39;t; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed). (This reminded me of &#34;Dark Star&#34; - which is about being &#34;lost in space&#34; - but this movie is just lost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talent was the bartender (he said \&#39;dog\&#39; so annoyingly that I knew he had to be acting... wasn\&#39;t he? ... now THAT\&#39;s acting!), the Mark Hammond guy, and Marty. I guess I gave the movie a point for each one of them... 3/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-LD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/&#39;

b&#39;Almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines (very briefly) and getting naked (not very briefly) in front of a anonymous (and uncredited) panel - almost certainly including producer Charles Band. Thrown in are random scenes of Surrender Cinema\&#39;s many movies (primarily lesbian scenes). Most of the women like &#34;riding horses&#34; (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition; a \&#39;secret; camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Lovell (too made up but still beautiful) introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a \&#39;sexy\&#39; Way to the camera (if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian \&#39;couple\&#39; ever). Weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women, a frankly dull and uninspiring experience.&#39;

b&#39;Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black &amp; white, while they conveniently forget that both &#34;Clerks&#34; and &#34;Schindler\&#39;s List&#34; were filmed in black &amp; white and are great movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn\&#39;t want to see a great movie just because it\&#39;s in black &amp; white are the same people who wouldn\&#39;t like &#34;Psycho&#34; anyway, because it doesn\&#39;t have a murder or sex scene every two minutes. And the murders are not the grisly blood/guts/gore/bone-snapping that people are used to from having seen &#34;Halloween,&#34; &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; and &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street.&#34; This is why remaking &#34;Psycho&#34; almost exactly as it was originally was destined to not work, because it\&#39;s really only of interest to people who are fans of the original. Everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next &#34;Scream&#34; sequel comes out, and for that reason, they will be disappointed. &#34;Psycho&#34; relies on suspense and mystery, not blood and guts. (And just so nobody thinks that I must be a senior citizen if I like older movies, let me set the record straight by saying that I am 21.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if doing the movie in color was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just colorize the movie and rerelease it? I mean, what\&#39;s the point of remaking a movie if you\&#39;re not going to change *anything*? The least he could have done was to put his own director\&#39;s spin on it, rather than just copying Hitchcock\&#39;s - or even better, hired a new writer to adapt a new script from the original &#34;Psycho&#34; book. But it seems that Van Sant couldn\&#39;t decide whether he wanted to remake &#34;Psycho&#34; *exactly* or not. This should have been an all or nothing project - either remake the movie exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches thrown in that don\&#39;t seem to have any purpose. Such as having Norman masturbate while he spies on Marion undressing. It doesn\&#39;t serve the plot at all, and the only reason he put it in was because he *could*. He wanted to say, &#34;Hitch couldn\&#39;t show people masturbating in 1960 so I\&#39;m going to do it.&#34; Whoopee, big deal, like I\&#39;m so shocked at seeing someone masturbate. And what on earth was the point of showing single frame shots of clouds and farm animals spliced into the murder scenes? And then he leaves *out* an important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the Sheriff outside the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, by using the almost exact same script, the entire movie seems a bit of an anachronism. The opening credits say that the year is 1998. Then what\&#39;s with Marion\&#39;s 60-ish looking dress or the parasol she carries with her? Why do Marion and Sam have to have their trysts in a hotel room, when these days nobody would be shocked by what they are doing? Why are there no air conditioners in Marion\&#39;s office? Why does the Bates Motel have no tv\&#39;s in the rooms, and apparently no automatic locks on the doors? Why does the Sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the Bates motel? This was why using the exact same script was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it. It needed a whole reworking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Vince Vaughn turned in a good performance as Norman, he just didn\&#39;t seem right for the part. Part of what made the original &#34;Psycho&#34; so creepy was that Norman had that innocent, boy-next-door quality, so nobody could believe that he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the part, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original &#34;Psycho&#34; movie, and wanted this to be a tribute. This isn\&#39;t a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be some people\&#39;s only exposure to &#34;Psycho.&#34; I really think you should see this movie only if you\&#39;ve seen the original. Since I am a fan of anything to do with &#34;Psycho,&#34; I bought a used copy of the remake, which I may watch occasionally. The original movie was a filet mignon, whereas the remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would get boring if you had it everyday, so it\&#39;s nice to have a hamburger once in a while, for a change.&#39;

b&#39;In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Taken out of context, if one did not know Brooks\&#39; work before viewing, the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn\&#39;t sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on. However, as a young generation Y\&#39;er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60\&#39;s TV show, this movie pained me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part. The backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese, shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them. It seems the screenwriters, unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for Don Adams famous lines, flashbacks to fat camp, references to Carell\&#39;s part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have seen the original, the writers of this movie thought they\&#39;d include some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless tiny furry dog that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro\&#39;d the show. The classic music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. Cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field, control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves Control\&#39;s past. The movie lacks any creative random tech, and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives. Lots of the &#34;humor&#34; in the movie is Carrel hurting himself, or another character being hurt, whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow, or getting punched by security guards, or throwing up in airplanes. In the original, Smart would insult a big foe, attack him with no success, and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized. In this one, he attacks without success and gets pummeled. It seems the screenwriters didn\&#39;t understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence. It\&#39;s like they took the names from the show, and cut out all that made it good in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poster hides Carell\&#39;s face beyond that of Hathaway\&#39;s. The movie likewise, shies away from anything that could make it good. They intertwine the classic music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films. Whereas the original fed off a campy feel, this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects. I was really looking forward to this, as I finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time. However, this was a massive disappointment. The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I\&#39;ve read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake, go for it. But be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I almost forgot the George Bush humor. They mention &#34;Nuculor&#34;, falling asleep at fine art, President\&#39;s working for their vice pres, and appreciating tackles over solving real problems. If you\&#39;re into hearing the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in big budget movie form, chuck your money here.&#39;

b&#39;One wonders how FLYNN could have failed so badly as a cinema release in 1997 with Guy Pearce aptly in the lead role. It is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right. FLYNN was a stumbler at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in Australia...even after LA CONFIDENTIAL...! From a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by Guy Pearce) FLYNN gets off to a fairly robust and interesting start. Sadly, FLYNN runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the entrance of hammy Steven Berkoff in a detour to New Guinea, (looking and acting like he wanted the Klaus Kinski role in FITZCARRALDO) the film starts to resemble a tele movie rather than a major cinema biography. Believe it or not, by about the 70 minute make, it is boring and you are glad to see it over. But such promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike The Bounty, sank without trace.&#39;

b&#34;I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don&#39;t know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don&#39;t know how many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) no background information or explanation on weather patterns. If you are going to make a movie about weather, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on Chicago... no more experts left in the field? 4) where are some interesting characters? I truly don&#39;t care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme. And this is only the first part of the film. I bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie, I can only imagine what we are to expect. Of course, at the end, the main characters will survive and life will go on... how original&#34;

b&#39;So, this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It\&#39;s up there with &#34;Crossbones&#34; and &#34;Southern Comfort&#34;, but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you\&#39;ve had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at it. This movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really. Ron Hall\&#39;s range of emotions are always off. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the cast couldn\&#39;t act their way out of a paper bag. The special (&#34;Short bus&#34; kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. Most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all. Mel Novak has the AUDACITY to look off-camera for his line, and it\&#39;s not even edited out. They just keep on filming. In fact, half of this movie isn\&#39;t even on film at all. It\&#39;s 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. This movie doesn\&#39;t just have a few plot holes, it\&#39;s a mine field of confusion and mental pain! But OH do I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this cinematic abomination. I went out and bought it, cause it\&#39;s just so damn funny. ($1.99 on Amazon, and I had it rush delivered!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I have weapons! I have weapons! I have WEAPONS!&#34;&#39;

b&#34;Found an old VHS version of this film in my parents house so I thought I&#39;d give it a go. Right from the start I wasn&#39;t expecting much from this film and I&#39;m glad for that because overall the film was no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting overall was very poor, even for a Nicolas Cage movie. One scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that I found it hilarious that this scene wasn&#39;t cut. The first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and I didn&#39;t know what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film. I managed to watch the whole thing but I won&#39;t likely ever see this film again.&#34;

b&#34;I can&#39;t remember the last time a movie was so boring that I walked out. The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it but I even stayed to the end in those. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on and on. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were just French humor that I didn&#39;t get or if the characters were serious. I finally just gave up and tried napping because I didn&#39;t want to disturb my husband if he was enjoying it but he noticed and let me know that it was OKAY if I wanted to leave and out the door we went. He would like to know how it ended...if Denevue lived or died etc...(I don&#39;t even care).&#34;

b&#34;Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, while disappointing to many, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers, so naturally I picked it up. I only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny. A far cry from Super Troopers. All in all, I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you have an abundance of free time, and really need to kill some time. However, you&#39;re better off playing video games, or watching something that might make you laugh or think.&#34;

b&#39;I mean, you just have to love the Italian film industry. Someone came up with a post-doomsday action movie (&#34;Road Warrior&#34;) and the Italians were busy for years doing one rip-off after another. Then some other one came up with a successful barbarian movie (&#34;Conan&#34;) and the Italians were busy... eh, see above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides countless other variations of the theme (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi\&#39;s &#34;The Barbarians&#34; starring the Paul twins) the Ator series was created. And this, the second one, is probably the worst (or best, depending on your point of view).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ator is called back into action by his old teacher, who has discovered some kind of nuclear power that, of course, has to be protected so it won\&#39;t get into wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator, and after a few complications Ator, his sidekick Tong and the girl set back to the castle, which meanwhile has fallen to some evildoer (of course, an old &#34;class mate&#34; of Ator). Somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets about the plot and eradicates some giant snake-worshipping cult for the fun of it (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just in time before the madman finally loses his temper and kills the wise teacher our heroes remember their duties, invent hanggliding and grenades and save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included: terrible acting by all participants (especially O\&#39;Keeffe), incredibly hilarious &#34;special effects&#34; (you just have to adore the snake fight scene, which must be sort of a hommage to &#34;Bride of the Monster&#34;), badly staged fight scenes, numerous continuity errors (Ator flies two different hanggliders during the climatic battle, watch for it, just an example) and an overall non-understanding of the concept of history (cavemen, &#34;civilized&#34; barbarians, castle-builders, all thrown in one film).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re, like me, devoted to bad movies, this is the one of the series to see, you\&#39;ll probably end up ROTFL. For the records: the Malta-filmed third part is actually quite watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering Joe D\&#39;Amato\&#39;s other efforts this is probably his most entertaining movie, as he certainly has failed to deliver watchable horror or erotic movies. But I strongly have the opinion that this was completely by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#39;I am speechless, honestly I cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. The fact that I am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed. I am disappointed in Flex Alexander for even thinking about accepting such a POOR EXCUSE FOR A SCRIPT let alone essay the role. OMG! I think I just insulted the word &#34;essay&#34;...uh yeah I did. Y\&#39;know what, the less said about this mindless drivel, the better. You have been warned, nobody warned me I had to experience the horror myself. WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK.&#39;

b&#39;One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a &#34;famous quote&#34; by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject\&#39;s life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O\&#39;Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80\&#39;s AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp\&#39;s persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan\&#39;s East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because &#34;after a few years the dust doesn\&#39;t get any worse,&#34; or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you\&#39;d never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the &#34;streets of New York&#34; scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the period. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one\&#39;s skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt\&#39;s performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.&#39;

b&#39;After an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed &#34;Attack of the Giant Leeches&#34; (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on &#34;Columbo&#34;. Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed. What comes across as interesting is the poor effects, not the actual film itself. One scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and it\&#39;s an embarrassing cartoon representation. Even for 1958. And then when a full-grown alien appears... you\&#39;ll wonder why he is wearing shoes. Or if you\&#39;re really perceptive, you\&#39;ll wonder why you\&#39;ve seen the alien suit in other movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means is this the worst science fiction film you\&#39;ll ever see. And you almost have to give it some credit -- the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both &#34;The Thing&#34; and &#34;Alien&#34; by a number of years. I don\&#39;t know if these films were inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. Beyond that, though, the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking. I haven\&#39;t seen the &#34;Mystery Science Theater&#34; version, but this sure is one film worthy of their insults.&#39;

b&#34;I am a fan of Ed Harris&#39; work and I really had high expectations about this film. Having so good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie of Harris&#39; filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake. Anyway, I&#39;ve seen much worse movies in my life but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. The story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake. I don&#39;t know if that is because of the book, &#39;cause I haven&#39;t read it. But if the script was so bad, I can&#39;t see the reason for filming it. Maybe it was the commercial success of King&#39;s books, or the need for low-quality movies for the VHS era of the 90&#39;s. Whatever the reason was, though, this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Wild Rebels&#34; was probably a fun second film at a drive in movie triple feature 40 years ago. It hasn\&#39;t aged very well, but it was never meant to age well; it was obviously intended to be disposable, forgettable fun from its inception. Taken on that level, it\&#39;s a good example of the biker flick genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several elements help distinguish it from the dozens of similar films being churned out at the same time. The \&#39;hero\&#39;, \&#39;Rod Tillman\&#39; (Steve Alaimo) comes off as somewhat of an unimpressive \&#39;Everyman\&#39; - he\&#39;s not especially brave, tough, talented, or handsome (although he does win a fight with a tough biker gang member halfway into the film, and the girl gang member chooses to help him over her fellow gang member at the end of the film). The soundtrack is quite well done, featuring a nice \&#39;Ventures\&#39; style bass/drum riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that pep things up quite a bit. And although the script is pretty shallow, all the actors inhabit their cardboard characters convincingly and with a fair amount of energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of careless technical gaffes: terrible \&#39;day-for-night\&#39; scenes that occur in broad daylight, squealing tires in a swamp, fire sirens mistakenly stuck on the soundtrack instead of police sirens, a bank sign made of duct tape on a ceiling tile, a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06, shotgun blasts that cut down people 100 yards away, a detective killing a biker on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2 inch barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a whole bunch of goofy story elements : Linda (the girl gang member) disables a bank guard with a drug-filled syringe, the final shootout takes place inside a lighthouse (!), police roadblocks don\&#39;t actually block roads, the police apparently never heard of ducking, and the police detectives apparently never heard of planting bugs or having their undercover guy wearing a wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the plot chugs along, the cameraman knows what he is doing, the pacing in most scenes is pretty good, and there are some nice, zippy one liners and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level up. (My favorite: &#34;Man, you\&#39;re messing with private stock! (ie, Linda)&#34; So no, don\&#39;t seek this one out or anything, but if a copy of the MST version should fall in your hands, you should have some good, shallow fun watching it. Vastly superior to &#34;Five the Hard Way&#34; or &#34;The Hellcats&#34; or even \&#39;Girl In Gold Boots\&#39; (three other MST covered counter culture movies).&#39;

b&#34;This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You&#39;re a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don&#39;t know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.&#34;

b&#39;In Moscow, the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and I napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat each lost scene. However, the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button, to end this crap faster. My vote is one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Cidade Sombria&#34; (&#34;Dark City&#34;)&#39;

b&#39;I have just recently seen Heaven\&#39;s Gate. After i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that\&#39;s not a western, i read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie, i have to ask why. Though this isn\&#39;t a reason to hate it, it is historically way off. It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply, the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. After you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people died. I can\&#39;t warn you enough off this movie. However, if you\&#39;re like me the, the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put United Artists on the &#34;for sale&#34; lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, watch this terrible, narsisistic, movie with no sub-text, and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes)&#39;

b&#39;Normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies. And i really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn\&#39;t. The jokes aren\&#39;t funny enough! (I\&#39;ve seen my share of Japanese movies. And most of the times I like and understand the humor used in those movies. &#34;Red Shadow&#34; is just silly!)The characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn\&#39;t a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. Look at the characters from parodies like &#34;Hot Shots&#34; or &#34;Scary Movie&#34;. Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! And because of this, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. In &#34;Red Shadow&#34; the actors never achieve that. The shadow ninja\&#39;s supposed to be very skilled and deadly. Sadly the actors don\&#39;t do their best in convincing us of their talents. They don\&#39;t do things with a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. &#34;Red Shadow&#34; just fails in that department. So what is left to be enjoyed. Well,the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be as the action it self never is exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor,lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children. But I do wonder if children actually would like this movie. Waste of time!&#39;

b&#34;I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I expect I may have been the only viewer. From the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal film just plain old shoddy bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was this made into a movie? I&#39;ve seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was alright but I only saw repeats of that because they made this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end I was none the wiser. I seem to remember at some point a character, maybe Farina&#39;s mentions that the Mod Squad can get in to places regular cops can&#39;t. The &#39;place&#39; turns out to be a &#39;club&#39;, one of the toughest places to get into, maybe it was student night? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it an action comedy? I don&#39;t remember any laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him Ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off.&#34;

b&#39;My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on Cable TV. As someone who saw Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980\&#39;s flick. The title should have simply been &#34;Revenge of The Dorks.&#34; Perhaps the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.&#39;

b&#34;Supreme Sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the U.S. government. She has to kill a known TV reporter, but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter. Because she hasn&#39;t killed him, she becomes the next target of her employers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script isn&#39;t good although I&#39;ve seen worse B-movies. A hit-man with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror,... What&#39;s next? Aliens rescuing the victim??? No, Supreme Sanction will never win any award because of the script. And the acting isn&#39;t any better I&#39;m afraid. A few better known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie, together with some other actors who probably don&#39;t even know what a camera really looks like don&#39;t do any good to the movie either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you haven&#39;t got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10,531st rerun of Mc Gyver or the A-team, than this might be the movie you want to see. Otherwise you better leave it alone. I give it a 3/10.&#34;

When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo comes to London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Transgredire&#34; is another &#34;soft porn&#34; of the sick director Tinto Brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. The amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful Yuliya Mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her nice body, but without showing explicit penetration. This flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing Yuliya Mayarchuk naked in erotic situations. My vote is four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;A Pervertida&#34; (&#34;The Pervert&#34;)&#39;

b&#39;I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke\&#39;s Robicheaux mysteries. When I read \&#39;In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead\&#39; was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don\&#39;t get me wrong, I don\&#39;t mind blood and gore-I love \&#39;The Untouchables\&#39; and \&#39;The Godfather Trilogy\&#39;. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen \&#39;Birth\&#39; and \&#39;What Just Happened\&#39; before watching this. I know that Burke\&#39;s books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of \&#39;In The Electric Mist\&#39;, can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. In a book, that\&#39;s fine. In a film, that\&#39;s confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt it was such a waste of their talents overall-they gave good performances in a film that didn\&#39;t hold together. Now, I say this, having only seen the USA DVD and hoping that Tavernier\&#39;s cut will make a huge difference. On the plus side: The soundtrack was wonderful. The scenes at Robicheaux\&#39;s place were perfect-just as I imagined the bait shop to look like. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is an even-tempered person in the beginning of the film, and then starts whacking people with various instruments. Overall, I wish that they had filmed more of the \&#39;Electric Mist and the Confederate Dead\&#39; and left out large portions of Robicheaux\&#39;s methods of interrogation, explaining Elrod\&#39;s gifts and his bond to Dave, as well as Dave\&#39;s to the General. Then I wouldn\&#39;t be feeling today as I did last night when I turned it off, &#34;What just happened?&#34;&#39;

b&#39;Being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture, but this film just did not hold my interest or attention. This story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend, since his wife died a few years back. These people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them. This film reminded me of a film called &#34;Children of the Corn&#34; because it really involves children who are being presented to Satan and are his instruments of terror. There is plenty of chants, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife.&#39;

b&#34;Talk about false advertising! What was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place? I think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but this had only the blackness without any comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and un-funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was also good, but generally the movie falls apart because we don&#39;t really see a good enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so badly. The ending was disappointing as well. What would Buddy&#39;s motivation be for letting Guy get away with what he did? This isn&#39;t really explained AT ALL. Why would Buddy go for such a plan? Wouldn&#39;t it be more like Buddy to screw Guy completely by turning him over to the police? The ending didn&#39;t seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how I looked at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I disliked the film despite the good acting. Spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film, but towards the end he gives Buddy a bit of needed humanity. The story just wasn&#39;t as good as the cast.&#34;

b&#34;This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason why I&#39;ve given it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh. Without giving anything away, a man&#39;s head actually explodes in this film. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I don&#39;t believe the scene was meant to be funny but it&#39;s nonsense.

b&#34;To identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Simply because it will suck the life right out of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vampire Effect is an insult to movie-buffs everywhere. The plot is almost non-existent. The make-up is just plain awful. And the acting is just not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of Jackie Chan on the front (as though he was playing the lead) and thought that a good JC flick would be fun to watch. This movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can&#39;t help staring at the car wreck when you drive by. You realize very quickly the movie isn&#39;t going to get any better but, you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get.&#34;

b&#39;A funny thing happened to me while watching &#34;Mosquito&#34;: on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. On the other hand, the English version at least is very badly dubbed. So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). Not to mention the &#34;romantic&#34; aspect (oh, how sweet!)...Miss it. (*)&#39;

b&#34;This review took longer to write than I took to watch this film. It&#39;s just plain bad. The plot is terrible in comparison to the TV shows. It is flat, unfunny and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is clear that the LoG ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit. Viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamism, zilch chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film that doesn&#39;t know what it is, made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LoG obviously were made an offer they couldn&#39;t refuse, or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them. It&#39;s a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the LoG were fresher and more inspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however, did know when to stop, and did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please!

b&#34;The only good part of this movie was the ending. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. No no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended. As long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well. As for Chayanne&#39;s debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth. As for going to see the movie wait for the rental or TV. Do not make the same mistake I did and pay 8.50&#34;

b&#39;**SPOILERS** The killer in the movie doesn\&#39;t wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway. We then get this official looking prologue, as if were watching a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn. There\&#39;s at least two times when Delboys says that they\&#39;ll never be another murder as long as he\&#39;s on the case and within minutes another murder happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff\&#39;s daughter, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book about Withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the Salem Witch Trials. This cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. When the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You never get a handle to what\&#39;s exactly happening in the movie &#34;Blood Cult&#34; not just because it\&#39;s totally disjointed story but it\&#39;s ever more outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by Charles Ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff Ron Delboys. Getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into. The bumbling Sheriff Delboys ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive, after being dismembered. The only reason he wasn\&#39;t is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the Witches Cult that\&#39;s responsible for the sorority murders. The movie doesn\&#39;t bother to explain at all if the dream, that the drugged Sheriff Delboys had, was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house, while munching down a bag full of McDonald cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. Shefiff Delboys find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he, or she, is but he\&#39;s also willing to let the killer escape!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first straight to video motion picture and it shows. Not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission, at least with the video you can tape over it Thank God, to see this disaster but no movie-house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons, in a justifiable show of righteous indignation, tear the place apart!&#39;

b&#34;This movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of Michael J. Fox&#39;s generally respectable career. I should have known how awful this movie was when I rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter. Never a good sign! Fox plays a grown up child star who&#39;s now an agent for other show business kids. His character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all likeable. In fact, the only likeable character in the whole movie is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box warning others not to waste their time!&#34;

b&#39;The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn\&#39;t everything. She realizes that she can &#34;feel&#34; and &#34;see the real world&#34;. Touching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mother - high strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) that need taking care of by a strong man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The father - patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comedian clown Chinese guy that doesn\&#39;t know how to speak English properly and made a laughing stock. Thought Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in China that in the next moment is a carbon copy of The mother i.e. a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deformed Chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl. Because in China (a third world country according to the film) don\&#39;t have anything and hence needs our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you are shoveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure that there are some poverty in China but the portrayal of the aid from western countries (read USA) is so shallow and happy ending-ish that it is sad and revolting. Shanghai (where the movie is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teacher (Sean Astin) that has this really heart ripping story (not) that he tells without feel. Why Sean? WHY!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etc etc. It is difficult to actually finding a &#34;real&#34; person in the entire movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing but a feel good movie for Americans below age 15. If you want to learn anything about the world watch e.g. Hotel Rwanda instead. For a better life story or coming of age movie I suggest you watch the Italian &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34; that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese country side. I have been there and seen some of it.&#39;

b&#34;Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But &#39;Mamma Mia&#39; - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard&#39;s musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I&#39;m acting)Streep can&#39;t even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - &#39;The Winner Takes It All&#39; - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labour really have reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone???&#34;

b&#39;This movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board must have excited the money men. All I can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week. Jacobi camps it up in the way that only Jacobi can do and I thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in Frasier a few years back. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man. He is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a TV series, it may have just got picked up. However, the scipt and the camera work were appalling. Quite why this &#34;jounalist&#34; and a press officer from the Met would ever work together is never explained. It certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry, of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original, but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all. It was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours. Go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours. You life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish&#39;

b&#39;Okay, I just had to sound off on this one... Like a tremendous mental-gimp, I\&#39;ve just sat through this film in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;ll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were &#34;borrowed&#34; from Airport 1977. This really doesn\&#39;t scratch the surface... Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean, landing in, sinking, and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport \&#39;77. All of the &#34;raising&#34; shots are pulled from \&#39;77, including most of the interior flooding clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver\&#39;s drowning. I couldn\&#39;t help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment, or maybe a &#34;dead&#34; Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver\&#39;s name in this film is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that Airport \&#39;77\&#39;s plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don\&#39;t work much, or at least haven\&#39;t worked in a while, which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve rated this film a 2 - It\&#39;s quite worthy of a &#34;1&#34;, but if this film can\&#39;t offer any other redeeming quality, at least somebody helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert, and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!&#39;

b&#39;First off, I would like to make it clear that I voluntarily subject myself to the viewing of terrible movies. I have seen what I thought were the worst of the worst. In my mind, movies could not get any worse than the likes of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood, and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pirate Movie, without any exaggeration, is the WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I was informed prior to watching that the movie was, indeed, awful, but I did not believe the allegations. Believe me when I tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. &#34;The End&#34; splashes across the screen. Unfortunately, it is not the actual end of the movie. The movie is about an unpopular, awkwardly nerdy girl named Mabel, who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to ambiguously homosexual pirate boys. She drowns and has a overly drawn out hallucination in which she stars as a scantily dressed skank who falls in love with Frederic, who happens to have just crawled out of the ocean. He might actually be homosexual. The Pirate King has a ruby and diamond studded codpiece. It honks and squeaks when he squeezes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is singing in this movie. You might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical. It isn\&#39;t. Trust me. They are the worst songs that you\&#39;ve ever heard, and by the end of the first original tune you will be searching for objects to pierce your eardrums with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are &#34;references&#34; to other movies in here. By references, of course, I mean &#34;obvious rip-offs.&#34; The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau, and the lightsaber were, in fact, anti-hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue is, in its better moments, painful to hear. The direction is flat out awful, and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene, which isn\&#39;t very well hidden at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. If you cherish your mental capacity then I beg of you, NEVER EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE.&#39;

b&#39;If you watch the documentary extra, you\&#39;ll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker bud of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realise Quentin is doing a favour for his old bud, despite the bud being rather talentless. Was that harsh? Well see this film and you\&#39;ll realise it isn\&#39;t. Too slow in the beginning, too nonsensical in the middle, and too slow to end. That about sums it up. Eric Stolz &amp; Delpy were the only two showing some charisma. And Kemp actually put in an OK performance. But the rest was real bad. One instance of plot stupidity was when &#34;lead robber&#34; accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid. So what happens? Well the other robbers decide they may as well remove theirs too! What great thinking. The violence was relentless and insane. But not in a &#34;cool&#34; way. Rather in a farcical way. I wondered if this was meant to be a comedy. More fool Tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage. More fool me for watching it.&#39;

b&#39;I saw this movie one time at a kiddie matin\xc3\xa9e at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11. It was one of three features that were shown that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen it since but have wanted to because I am a film buff and appreciate the terrible along with the great, good and average films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members, consisting of children between 8 and 15, howled with laughter at the tree monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A triple bill at a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget, but I can\&#39;t remember the names of the other 2 films. (One did star George Montgomery and David Farrar.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The other 2 films in this triple bill were much better. They were &#34;Watusi,&#34; 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and &#34;The Angry Red Planet,&#34; 1959, with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden staring. Ms. Hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also.&#39;

b&#39;..but unfortunately no one thought about having Van killed in order to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy. Why did I hate Van so much? Well, throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging, bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he was &#34;teaching&#34; the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch\&#39;s brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices, the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van. Now in real life, he might have been a lovely person and it\&#39;s sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I also mentioned the songs--egad, those terrible songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickly sweet children\&#39;s movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you can remove these problems, you have the basis of a decent film. After all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through the treacle?! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this film was included in &#34;The 50 Worst Films&#34; book by Harry Medved. While I, too, disliked the film, it wasn\&#39;t bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the &#34;hallowed hall&#34; of dreck.&#39;

b&#39;Watching &#34;Baghban&#34; is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one\&#39;s way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours. This Indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts off like &#34;King Lear,&#34; moves on to &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; in the middle section, then heads back again to &#34;King Lear&#34; for its tear-soaked finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raj Malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life: a wife who adores him, a family who loves him, and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service. Even though Raj and his wife, Pooja, have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons, they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds, cooing and sighing, batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other\&#39;s ears almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody brood is so happy, loving and harmonious that they make the Von Trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison. The parents and children joke together, laugh together, even perform elaborately choreographed, &#34;spontaneous&#34; song-and-dance numbers together (like many Bollywood productions, &#34;Baghban&#34; is a drama interspersed with a great number - in this case, far too great a number - of musical sequences).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long, and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers. Knowing this, we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation, wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive. The thunderclap occurs about an hour into the film, when Raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families, leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses. Suddenly, like King Lear discovering the vipers hidden in the familial bosom, Raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving, selfless and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought. Understandably horrified at the prospect, the kids, in order to foil their parents\&#39; plan, come up with a scheme in which Raj will go live with one of their children, while Pooja will live with another; then they will switch off until, eventually, each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum. Much to the chagrin of the kids, the parents accede to the plan, even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart. Thus, the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging (albeit married) lovers pining away for one another, while their ungrateful, insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major problems with &#34;Baghban&#34; is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for one another, as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit, is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality. Then, virtually without any warning, the screenplay turns on a dime and converts the kids into callous, self-centered monsters and the parents into passive, whiny victims of that callousness. Raj and Pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed, pouting, unrequited love bit, more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children. The purple prose style, in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation. The musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning, but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions. At least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done - and quite a bit of good. There really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours. Most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end, a speech in which Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller) lectures us all on the verities of parent/child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Baghban&#34; is a sappy, corny saga, filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of See\&#39;s chocolates. Sample at your own risk.&#39;

b&#39;World War I gets a glossy, sepia-tinted makeover in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\&#39;s relentlessly whimsical &#34;A Very Long Engagement&#34;. Jeunet\&#39;s trademark style consists of mechanical, almost clockwork-like narrative construction garnished with lavish, chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux-naive humour. It\&#39;s an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture, the romantic fantasy &#34;Amelie&#34;, thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role. Applied to vastly more sombre material, Jeunet\&#39;s method backfires rather badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off-beat character as Amelie. She\&#39;s Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), several years after he went missing in the War. Manech was one of five soldiers court-martialled for self-mutilation in 1917 at \&#39;Bingo Crepuscule\&#39;, and sent over the top into no-man\&#39;s-land as a punishment. He\&#39;s presumed dead by all but Mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde\&#39;s dogged quest to find out what really happened, and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad, even shocking story of high-ranking corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting, overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be Manech\&#39;s final hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this should be poignant and gripping, but it\&#39;s more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which Jeunet pummels his audience. There\&#39;s simply too much going on at any one time, including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters. Without a moment\&#39;s respite from informational overload, I felt denied the space to reflect on Mathilde\&#39;s quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms. Jeunet\&#39;s unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles, caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production, but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story\&#39;s skin. The result is deeply uninvolving, and worse, grotesque. The First World War was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine it re-created as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known Belgian lager, and you have the measure of this film.&#39;

b&#39;I bought a DVD collection (9 movies for 10 Euros) where this one was included. It turned out to be the &#34;uncut version&#34; whatever that means. Beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. It started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts. After around 2 minutes I had an expression on my face which fitted the term &#34;boooooooooooooring!&#34; quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the movie was more like &#34;people aren\&#39;t /that/ stupid, are they?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky me, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back.&#39;

b&#39;This is a comedy version of &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34;. It works pretty well. I am a harsh grader, so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot. The performances are extremely good, all of them. Of course, the two stars, DeVito and Crystal, shine most. Each performer acts well enough to play off of. The comedy works in a level just short of slapstick. DeVito characters work best when depraved. His character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are. His character would, in real life, have a great agent and multiple solicitations. The characters are one dimensional, which is okay in comedy. But Crystals\&#39;s character is not written very well. His desire to kill the &#34;moma&#34; all of a sudden makes no sense at all. It looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. The pitiful attempts are not too often, and the movie flows fairly well.&#39;

b&#34;... when dubbed into another language. Let&#39;s face it: Neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog. And given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose-loose situation. Any type of voice-over is sure to be an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the German version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is only a minor point. The acting is bad. The speeded up combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen couldn&#39;t use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and to the athleticism shown off by Sandahl Bergman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the visuals are nice, I&#39;ll have to grant that. The dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. But more often than not the plaster is all too evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the movie isn&#39;t worth seeing. Even &#39;Conan the Destroyer&#39; is better than this (although only marginally). I would have much rather seen Bergman as Red Sonja as she was originally supposed to be, but I doubt that that could have saved this movie - oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#34;

b&#39;Not many people remember &#34;The Carey Treatment&#34;, and I can\&#39;t say I blame them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (i.e. - between &#34;Pink Panther&#34; movies.) and for a story of a doctor turned detective (Coburn) working to solve a murder in his hospital, it\&#39;s actually pretty forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coburn is dependable as always and O\&#39;Neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings. The story twists and turns aren\&#39;t very involving and even the climax, which is supposed to be nerve-wracking, is gut-wrenching instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A missed opportunity altogether, and an unfortunate one at that, since it was based on a Michael Crichton book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, at least Crichton didn\&#39;t write a sequel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star. &#34;Carey&#34; on, Coburn.&#39;

b&#39;Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don\&#39;t want most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn\&#39;t make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton\&#39;s dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for \xc2\xa350,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest\&#39;s mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wealth of things arise here which just don\&#39;t add up : &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn\&#39;t that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, I may add - to take confession? No way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren\&#39;t the cops checking the place out? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin\&#39;s blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He\&#39;s on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church &#34;fixing&#34; the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don\&#39;t even check up on him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Why get Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You\&#39;d think you\&#39;d want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Why does Bates\&#39; brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in &#34;love&#34; with him in record time - a few days !!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates\&#39; point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates\&#39; houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13. Hoskin\&#39;s priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke\&#39;s hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oooppps - I have just mentioned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10.&#39;

b&#34;I was a little to old for this show I was 6 when it first came out. First off when I was a young child there were a few children&#39;s shows that were on sesame street which I did watch and learned from, but other than that there wasn&#39;t much else. My Cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter. Barney was a very big part of what they watched. When I first saw this show I told my grandmother how it doesn&#39;t teach anything just uses magic to fix everything. I was 9 at the time, how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a TV show. More and more that I saw or heard what the teachings of Barney were the more and more I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80&#39;s which was me by the way. They agreed and said the same thing as I did. The sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw. Its not cheating its creative, its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to. Its o.k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone. Lets be honest with ourselves, Barney is out to make money not teach children anything. The more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it. Children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better, second Barney put on a show and parents bought it. I never believed that TV could affect people the way Barney does. If you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers, do not let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking once is to much, smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought&#34;

b&#39;Even by the standards of most B-movies, this movie is by far the worst I\&#39;ve ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable, including the one scene where they board the mini-sub, and the &#34;water&#34; looks like its frozen in place. The problems with this film are so numerous that I\&#39;ll just stop here with the details. needless to say, I kid you not when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all cost, there are other B grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way of passing the time by.&#39;

Apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of Sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. Made by some Industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed miserably at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its clich\xc3\xa9d depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. Shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of &#39;what teens want to see in a movie&#39;. The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. It is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. Well the were very wrong. A mini budget film made in 1983 called GOING DOWN got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison.&#34;

b&#39;I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The main character is completely clueless and astoundingly unsympathetic, but there is no humor in his blundering. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the screenwriter pulls the old &#34;there\&#39;s only one room in the hotel, you\&#39;ll have to share a room with a pretty girl&#34; stunt. Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first. Watch &#34;It Happened One Night&#34; to see how to do it right--or any of a thousand movies since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is consistently third-rate, and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting-room floor. It meanders with no plan at all, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationship\&#39;s destination from the moment Greta is introduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first song, in the boardroom, is mildly funny but badly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I only heard those in the first half-hour) are just pointless and awful. Most of the singers are painfully out of tune, but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way.&#39;

b&#34;This film was okay, but like most TV series it would of been better if it just made for television. The best and most loved characters only had five minute roles, whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most British movies that are based on television series, this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film then doesn&#39;t go anywhere when Hillary in a room with the captured Steve, Lipp masquerading as Steve, and Geoff somehow writing himself in to the Medieval times. Which made me think &#39;hang on? How come he doesn&#39;t need a key to enter in to that world unlike the Royston Vasey characters? The medieval scene was okay but Monty Python did it a lot better and of course funnier, with cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, both didn&#39;t say anything funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just sat up on wall looking bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean in the television in series 2, but in the film he&#39;s escaped from prison, and also Lipp is a paedophile vampire which wasn&#39;t mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he&#39;s left alone looking after the children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did Geoff and the Dark One escape from the Medieval times back in to Royston Vasey? Like Series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They would of been better off doing what Monty Python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from Series 1-3 and the Christmas special, and turned that in to a film which would of re-introduced the characters to a whole new audience, who can&#39;t be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the DVDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best advice is save your money and wait till it&#39;s on television..... Where it belongs.&#34;

b&#34;Well, it wasn&#39;t a complete waste. Armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs German thing was kind of strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint&#39; bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in. Never saw a movie where the characters looked Italian, supposed to be Turk, taking English(American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing else better to do, you can watch this movie..&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Graduation Day&#34; is a result of the success of &#34;Friday the 13th.&#34; Both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film, I\&#39;d recommend &#34;Graduation Day.&#34; If not, I wouldn\&#39;t. There\&#39;s nothing new here, just the same old killings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I\&#39;ve given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say that it\&#39;s not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative.&#39;

b&#34;Hailing from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci film I&#39;ve seen to date, prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get worse as you get later into his career. Considering the plot synopsis, I was expecting some bloody bad-natured fun with this one, but for all its bizarre flourishes, it feels tedious even at a running time of just 80 minutes, and suffers from nauseatingly shabby production values and film-making craft (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El Story: A gambling addict widower wines and dines rich (and strange) women he finds via lonely hearts columns before offing them in gruesome fashion - sometimes eating them or feeding them to animals - and stealing their money to keep his debtors at bay. Sure, it&#39;s unlikely that just one man would be the host for so much screwed-up pathology all at once (addict, psycho/sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touch is actually the cheapest and sparsest looking Fulci film I&#39;ve seen. There&#39;s almost nobody in it, even in the background of shots out on the street, for instance. A newsreader who keeps appearing on the film&#39;s televisions to warn the non-existent cast about the maniac&#39;s latest doings operates out of the most pathetic TV studio on the planet. He never even gets to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off misaligned sheets of paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some scenes just go on and on with the protagonist muttering to himself about what he&#39;s done or what he&#39;s about to do, but the acting is nowhere near good enough to sustain this kind of thing, so the main outcome is viewer boredom. The film also looks bland and ugly in general. I&#39;ve read that it was intended to be an Italian telemovie (did it ever screen in that venue? With the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it does reek of crappy old telemovie production values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also Fulci&#39;s first foray into outright black humour, but he&#39;s just too graceless a director to make it work. Sometimes conspicuously cheerful or &#39;wacky&#39; music is used to play against a gruesome scene, for instance while the hero/villain is carving up a dead body in his basement. The effect isn&#39;t really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you&#39;d like it to be - it&#39;s mostly just hamfisted and crappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are of course some redeeming moments of gore (that you&#39;ll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven(!) of a woman who just won&#39;t quit life, even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club, and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it&#39;s not like he sought out women with these features, it&#39;s just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he&#39;s smooching up these women. The black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn&#39;t so poorly executed in general. In the end, Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.&#34;

b&#34;This is a stupid movie. When I saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over. I stayed to the bitter end. To show fortitude? I caught it again on television and it was much funnier. Still by no means a classic, or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you&#39;ve nothing better to do and it&#39;s free on t.v. you could do worse.&#34;

b&#39;Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I\&#39;ve seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it\&#39;s just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The &#34;witty&#34; parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a &#34;ho&#34;). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can\&#39;t stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10 stars--the lowest review I have ever given a movie.&#39;

b&#39;The concept for this movie was quite good. But somehow the execution failed on many parts. There aren\&#39;t many horror movies that I can think of that used dolls that looked so realistic. Especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving hands. So much could have been done with this premise. There were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I really was expecting creepy things to happen. But never did the movie managed to be scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. I actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist. Sadly this doesn\&#39;t happen. Well at least not in the way that I hoped for. The cast also failed to make it all believable. It would have been nice if more background was given on the characters. In the beginning when we get introduced to the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist. But it also is apparent that they don\&#39;t have an idea themselves what they are invited for. Of course this is part of the mystery. But it does seem unlikely. If I got an invitation without having a clue what the deal is I simply would not go. Furthermore most characters aren\&#39;t real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and aren\&#39;t even relevant to the &#34;Doll Master mystery&#34;. Overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see &#34;Dead Silence&#34;!&#39;

b&#39;John Wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. His career stretched over forty years, and within that time he starred in films such as &#34;Angel and the Badman&#34;, &#34;The Green Berets&#34;, &#34;Sands of Iwo Jima&#34;, &#34;Rio Bravo&#34;, &#34;North to Alaska&#34;, and &#34;The Undefeated&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s listed above are hailed as some of his best, unlike this 1934 effort &#34;Randy Rides Alone&#34;, which has been pretty much forgotten about as time\&#39;s gone on, which is unsurprising, as it\&#39;s nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never really explained, arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. While looking around, a posse arrives and finds Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. He is put in jail accused of the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered, arrives at the jail to see Randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members ( She was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place ). Sally doesn\&#39;t believe that Randy is a killer, and doesn\&#39;t recognise him, so while the sheriff is out, she slips him the keys and Randy escapes. While running away from the sheriff and his posse, Randy conveniently stumbles into the gang\&#39;s hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders. Randy sets out to clear his name, and also to bring the gang to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Randy Rides Alone&#34; can be a fun film to watch, especially if you\&#39;re a John Wayne fan. But at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore. The film is also extremely dated, as you would expect; we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. The acting isn\&#39;t great either, and Wayne\&#39;s character is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone ( In this case it\&#39;s by director Harry Fraser ). Harry Fraser is at the helm, and does a good enough job but the story is paper-thin. One can\&#39;t help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as Randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone. An explanation on why Randy was there is giving later on, which turns out to be something like he is a P.I who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town. To be honest I didn\&#39;t really pick it up, most of the time I was hoping for the movie to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that being said, I didn\&#39;t find this film to be completely terrible. I enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times. But it really isn\&#39;t a great film, and isn\&#39;t really worth watching or tracking down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#34;Randy Rides Alone&#34; is incredibly dated and is a tiresome Western with very few redeeming qualities. Can be fun but overall it isn\&#39;t a great movie and is certainly one of Wayne\&#39;s weaker outings.&#39;

b&#39;Let me start out by saying that I am a huge fan of Abbie Hoffman and have read Steal this Book and Steal this Urine Test. Also am a even bigger Jerry Rubin fan. But his movie was a discusting pile of rubbish that made a very PG version of Abbie Hoffman. The director took no chances into making Abbie Hoffman interesting in this movie. They despicted Stew Albert as a F***ing cartoon chjaractor devoid of intellegence, the man was a proffesor at Berkley for christsakes. Ok they did a horrid casting job for Anita Hoffman, did a Horrible job casting for the Jerry Rubin character. I just guess the movie doesnt fit the news flashes that I have seen of Abbie or the books that he wrote. The movie just didnt fit and upset me. Oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice over I have ever heard of Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies that I have ever rented that I could not sit all the way through because, I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his discruntled band of Yippies and this movie was just plain badly done. And it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the yippies they will see a terrible adaptation, and not get a true sense of reality. Instead they get a hollywoodized palanthra of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#39;Terrible adaptation of Heminway\&#39;s low key love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War 1. What\&#39;s wrong with this? Virtually everything. Hudson is WAY out of his depth here. He could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is far too old for her role (she\&#39;s 21 in the book--here she\&#39;s 38...and looks it!). Also her acting wavered between overdone and underdone! They took a simple low-key love story and blew it all out of proportion. The film is fatally long (a little over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; again. Some of the scenery is truly stunning (even on a small TV screen) but there\&#39;s not enough of a story to match the images. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER!!! The ending where Jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown theatrics had me fighting not to laugh! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse actor Vittorio De Sica overacts to a truly embarrassing degree. Overblown, self-indulgent, badly cast and slow. Pretty terrible. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick\&#39;s career as a producer. You might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but it\&#39;s really not worth it. I give this a 3.&#39;

b&#39;Would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a &#34;British neo-noir&#34; crime film with a cast almost entirely American? The accents spoken in this film are bloody awful! But entirely in keeping with the performances, which are so wooden, one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? Even neo-noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for, even if they\&#39;re wretched and doomed; they at least have some decency to them, some sense that what they\&#39;ve done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they\&#39;re stuck with the responsibility for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in this stanky stew. These characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves, and the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that they are low-lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to be living a life of luxury. For a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves, the keynote here is - ennui. It\&#39;s all so terribly dull and dross, doncha know. So let\&#39;s just rip some people off or maybe murder them, and go get laid in a luxury hotel. What ambition! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are: boringly uneven pacing; predictable \&#39;action\&#39; sequences that aren\&#39;t; banal and incoherent set-design; made-for-bad-TV camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wholly unbelievable, unlikeable, and for less dedicated movie watchers(or masochists) like myself, utterly unwatchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other nasty things I would like to say about this nasty film, but they wouldn\&#39;t print them here. Suffice it to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film - just about anything, in fact.&#39;

b&#34;Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops. Again, how many times? There was not an original shred in this entire concoction. Giovanni Ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script, drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. And the thought of he and Claire Danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. Note to screenwriters: Buy one of those story generators. It can&#39;t possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. Note to auteur: There are shots available to you other than closeups. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. Note to cinematographer: Apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. Note to color timer at the lab: At least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this paid for your new condo. It&#39;s time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.&#34;

b&#39;OK, I\&#39;ve now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn\&#39;t Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn\&#39;t good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That\&#39;s the case here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. The &#34;heroine&#34; seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the &#34;hero&#34; is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn\&#39;t even get a good transformation scene out of the deal. His make up effects aren\&#39;t scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not a total waste. Zucco looks good on camera, he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow. There are some moody B&amp;W shots here and there that don\&#39;t completely suck. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all...this movie helped some &#34;C&#34; through &#34;Z&#34; level actors pay their rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.&#39;

b&#39;After a meteorite lands in &#34;Boston&#34; (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl\&#39;s school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. This isn\&#39;t. Let\&#39;s start with all the problems\xc2\x97the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad. This film is supposed to take place in Boston (we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting &#34;Boston police&#34; or &#34;Boston gas company&#34; on everything), yet everyone seems to have rather muddled British accents (At least they didn\&#39;t try using Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big flawed mess. The best example of how dumb the writing is when it\&#39;s established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, they run around SHOOTING the zombie-students instead. Nice. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie &#34;Grim&#34;, clearly doesn\&#39;t know how to pace his films. The movie is terribly boring in places. The lighting is awful. The film looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away, while we hear they\&#39;re &#34;horrified&#34; screams off in the distance. This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn\&#39;t work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God\&#39;s sake! The &#34;explosion&#34; of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful. Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I\&#39;ll give credit where credit\&#39;s due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool. Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum the film up, &#34;Breeders&#34; is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5/10.&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;ve been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the very beginning. The most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown. Kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving. A spiritual character, yet sweetly and believably so. All the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together, respecting each other\&#39;s difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe. Yet this &#34;It\&#39;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&#34; would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave. These characters have been completely re-written to be horny, nasty, selfish, and cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast goes on to portray God as an uncaring corporate head, with a mean streak. Angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad I had to stop watching. I had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately I preview anything I give a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame, shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from Jim Henson\&#39;s original heart-centered, socially conscious version. It does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations.&#39;

b&#34;In all honesty, I haven&#39;t seen this film for many years, but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can&#39;t risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s available on home video or not, but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.&#34;

b&#34;It&#39;s difficult to express how bad this movie is. Even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts, clean clothes, haircuts, etc. was a common reaction to the smug middle-class mores of both the USA and western Europe, this movie would have been a stinker. The plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina (if that&#39;s the correct Latin grammar); the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics (by the male lead as well as the females); the gratuitous view of Catherine Deneuve&#39;s (or somebody&#39;s) breasts are worthy of a Budweiser commercial; the repeated cacaphonous orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is I&#39;m sure heavy with meaning in the director&#39;s mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie -- I&#39;m ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic. The scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot -- but underneath his clothes, this king has no substance.&#34;

b&#34;The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn&#39;t act. In fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor! Also his off screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn&#39;t help matters. Acting aside, the script is dull and slow. Also the Ranger himself doesn&#39;t show up until an HOUR in! There were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a PG. However I don&#39;t think it was that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few (very few) things done right here--the photography was truly beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with the William Tell Overture booming from the soundtrack) it&#39;s really rousing. But, all in all, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It&#39;s easy to see why this bombed. A 4--mostly for the photography.&#34;

b&#34;Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the very worst movie I&#39;ve seen all year, and I&#39;ve run across some doozies. There is nothing redeeming about this trash, from the characterization to the direction to the plot. Even the usually brilliant Dominique Swain couldn&#39;t save this movie. None of the characters are in the least bit sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (wonderfully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this dismal failure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******Possible Spoilers********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with Tart is that it rambles on without saying anything. It staggers about drunkenly instead of leading us along the path of the story. It also introduces numerous potentially tantalizing details (the hypochondriac brother, the mother&#39;s possessions constantly being repossessed, the anti-semitic classmate, the other classmate&#39;s murderous father) without successfully exploring a single one of them. And just when I finally thought that there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie crashes to an unexpectedly violent end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the movie feeling that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film from a writer/director who really needs to spend much more time working under more established film makers before foisting any more of her work on an unsuspecting public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this film 1 out of 10, and I&#39;m usually very generous, even with bad films.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m sorry but this guy is not funny. I swear I\&#39;ve heard heard 4 year olds come up with better jokes then some of his. &#34;Dee dee dee&#34; for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase I\&#39;ve ever heard. It lacks any creativity at all, and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you\&#39;ve reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim-witted on Mencia\&#39;s part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though every one compares this fool to Chappelle, their is no contest. First off they had very very different shows. I think all in all Menica\&#39;s show on average had only about 2 short 5 minute skits in between his 10 minute rants about god knows what. Chappelles show came off more as sketch comedy, with 2-4 skits that occupied all the show. All chappelle did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that he talks about on his standup specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anybody really want to listen to a bit George Lopez pioneered years before Mencia, but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead? Snowflake\&#39;s chance in Hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is even though most people hate this guy for his rascism, I just cant stand him for his imcompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority they could brand as &#34;controversial&#34; and then leave him to follow Chappelles path. The problem, is this guy made it very clear he doesn\&#39;t want to be Chappelle. So instead he conducts his crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground. Does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday, I know sure as hell I don\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot\&#39;s show is done. Personally after watching his standup, I don\&#39;t know how he got his own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc... In fact anyone is better than this fool.&#39;

b&#39;Well, This was my first IMAX experience so I was pretty blown away about that, primarily; although with hindsight, I can\&#39;t help wishing that it had been some other (less monochrome)film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnificent Desolation very much had the &#34;Programme for Schools&#34; feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a LOT like reading National Geographic Magazine in 3D. Weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some PowerPoint Presentation. There was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens; seemingly at your feel, that had a bit of a WOW factor but to be honest, that may have had more to do with me being an IMAX virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commentary, provided by Tom Hanks, I personally found very, (what\&#39;s a nice way to put it??) &#34;flag-wavingly nationalistic&#34; which didn\&#39;t go down too well in central London, judging by remarks overheard as we left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I loved the IMAX experience, but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day. The Moon isn\&#39;t a particularly colourful subject and to be honest, a lot of the 3D effects were lost in the monochrome scenery. All that would have been well, were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit&#39;

b&#39;This is possibly the worst of the worst. I am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and I can believe this movie was allowed to be made. The acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic. The camera work was also juvenile. One scene that comes to mind is outside a store. It is nighttime and you can see the moon, yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall. There was no street light to be seen. One character gets gutted at one point, yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post. Come on!!! It felt like I was watching a middle school play. I kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth &#34;hi mom&#34;. I can only give it two positive comments...it ended and it was good for a laugh. Please do not rent this movie!!!!&#39;

b&#34;I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost nonstop until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I was left speechless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t watch this movie if you&#39;re not into the Olsen twins or family movies.&#34;

b&#34;I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some swell pictures for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the movie. I didn&#39;t see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter&#39;s girlfriend was almast as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn&#39;t have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY, promising I&#39;d be back. Alas, I never did get back. One of life&#39;s unsung melodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post the pictures I made somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowland Scherman&#34;

b&#39;As a massive fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this film numerous times. However, I watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is, um, pretty dreadful, sad to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Famed rock music film director DA Pennebaker followed Mode around on their late 80s Music For The Masses tour, which promoted the superb album of the same name. The title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the Pasadena Bowl, but is also a reference to the movie being a \&#39;beginners course\&#39; on the band and how it ticks ie Depeche Mode 101. Amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring America is a second story thread covering a group of DM fans who\&#39;ve won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I said above, the concert footage is great. Mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. Though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece &#34;Violator&#34;, there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg Behind The Wheel, the majestic Never Let Me Down Again, Everything Counts, Just Can\&#39;t Get Enough from the Vince Clarke years, Shake The Disease and many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mode are onstage, they are brilliant. When they are not, they\&#39;re, well, very boring. Nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the US in the dying days of the Reagan administration. As an example, the probable &#34;highlight&#34; of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly thrilling stuff. I know all bands don\&#39;t have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band\&#39;s lead singer Dave Gahan. Gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power inside himself he can\&#39;t control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. There\&#39;s one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. The man clearly had issues back then, which thankfully have been resolved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the \&#39;fan tour\&#39; thread, well it\&#39;s unwatchable dross. Let\&#39;s not kid ourselves. Maybe it\&#39;s just because it\&#39;s all so *very* late 80s, but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. They are, to a person, singularly shallow and vapid people, whose antics are banal when they aren\&#39;t hide-your-face cringeworthy. Let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn\&#39;t onstage that is of any interest. Nothing. Endless scenes of kids spraying their hair, arguing pointlessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if Cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in \&#39;88/89. The love the youngsters have for the band is something I can definitely relate to, and is at times infectiously joyous, but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them, then I\&#39;d hate to see the outtakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the music is all that matters, and in this regard 101 excels. The Pasadena concert, one of their all time best gigs, makes the film worth seeing. The recent DVD edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance), and thus makes the DVD an absolute must for fans. The audio commentary by the band (minus Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly, far more interesting than the film itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a document of the boys from Basildon during their amphitheatre idol period, Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you\&#39;re looking for excitement, you\&#39;re better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).&#39;

b&#39;When I was 13 or so I was lucky enough to find this film. It was part of an endless Danish series of really cheesy stuff. This however was the cheesiest I ever owned - but I guess I sold it, too bad. Well what to write... Better than &#34;Manos: the hands of fate&#34; and worse than &#34;Critters 4&#34;. But it\&#39;s definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it. The acting isn\&#39;t that terrible compared to several other eighties trash - in fact I kind of like the old man even though he did\&#39;NWT look that Indian to me. But I guess you can\&#39;t have everything... Do yourselves a favour and look this up...&#39;

b&#34;Well, if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting; and, if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go; and, if you set aside the fact that I didn&#39;t find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting; well, if you set all that aside, this is still a REALLY terrible movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy/poor girl. I never really understood for a moment how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) ever got started. The inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The screenplay (by Michael Seitzman) is dull to the point of stupefying. How Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that this is a REALLY, REALLY terrible movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d give it a ZERO, but the IMDb doesn&#39;t provide for votes of ZERO. So I give it a one while holding my nose.&#34;

b&#34;To begin with its a rip off of the Japanese film Battle Royal except it&#39;s missing the one thing that made BR unique, balls.

b&#39;&#34;The Bone Snatcher&#34; starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen, and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well. Director Jason Wulfsohn sustains a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified. Immediately after that, the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature-feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival-race one by one. The second half of &#34;The Bone Snatcher&#34; is unendurably boring; with the inevitable love-story clich\xc3\xa9s as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces. The characters all are insufferable stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance. There\&#39;s the rookie who has to prove himself, the female with brain-capacity apart from her hot looks, the obnoxious experienced guy who redeems himself at the end through self-sacrifice and \xc2\x96 last but not least \xc2\x96 who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names. Wulfsohn tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space menaces of &#34;Alien&#34; and &#34;Predator&#34;. The ant-creature has infrared-vision and crumbles when shot at, yawn! The movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of decomposed bodies. This could have been a modest gem, but instead it\&#39;s less than mediocre. Avoid.&#39;

b&#34;Yeah, I know his character was supposed to be a drunk, and he may have been just acting goofy. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence really was drinking a lot and was intoxicated during his scenes in the film. Basically everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just the poor productions values... hard to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a film that just doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s a shame, too, since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story deals with a US war plane which is filled with gold, money, and medals, which crashes into a lake in New Zealand during WWII. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles onto it. At first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually getting $75 apiece for them! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. Before you can blink, all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals. The old drunk&#39;s business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. The resulting action just isn&#39;t as fun as you&#39;d hope it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is rather awful, save for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do some kind of (I guess) Austrailian accent, but it is hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren isn&#39;t too bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He&#39;s basically doing his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that&#39;s saying something. Hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. I don&#39;t recall if he&#39;d had them straightened by the time he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast are pretty untalented. Probably mostly locals who never did much else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film, and the lack of danger. The villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does have its strengths, though. The beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. Brian May&#39;s score sounds a little too much like the one in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful. The thing you&#39;ll remember most is the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence, though. He was almost enough to save this film. Almost. 4 of 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hound.&#34;

b&#34;This movie has made me upset! When I think of Cat in the hat. Im thinking of cat in the hat books. You know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. Well, I though that this movie would be a lot like that! But much to my suprise was nothing like the books! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie. In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you&#39;ll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. I think in short this means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn&#39;t because the movie has been opened. If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy.&#34;

b&#34;Recap: A lone swordsman, living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen, recollects how his life turned out to be as it is. It started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead, causing him to leave his home town. One of the swordsmen is Huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have Huang protected, and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: I&#39;ve seen the Redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. How the two versions differ I can&#39;t say, but the Redux is very heavily stylized in the way of Chinese Wuxia action. That is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. A comprehensible story. But true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore there are lots of colorful, very beautiful scenes, that are completely unrelated to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. Much is left out in the scenes, the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is put into the action genre. The poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. Only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action, the other couldn&#39;t be farther away from it. The movie in its entirety is very slow, dull and hence very boring. Not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might say that I&#39;m not a fan of this Chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems, most importantly that the visual is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I&#39;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#34;

b&#39;If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this ain\&#39;t it. If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good, then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this film, that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let\&#39;s start with the opening titles, that say &#34;Jack-O&#34;, and then add the word &#34;Lantern&#34;, as if the viewer wasn\&#39;t able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he\&#39;s in people\&#39;s houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn\&#39;t ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills, but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that, the plot consists of poor acting, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I\&#39;ve ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. The boy who is the lead in the film (the director\&#39;s son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But, having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a &#34;10th Anniversary Version&#34; of this movie (as if the original wasn\&#39;t good enough). And someone actually had the idea of making a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I\&#39;m not sure why).......I\&#39;ll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10...&#39;

b&#39;I have done some research on Ed Gien, and I have found a few interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien, was quiet and a loner, not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie. I will say that I didn\&#39;t finish this movie but I will. I will cringe through the fact that all of us, Wisconsinites, talk like we are from Kentucy. You know the funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie, is Wisconsin isn\&#39;t as hot as they made it look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not only an insult to Wisconsin people, being a Wisconsite myself, but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane, lonely man. He killed two people and the movie couldn\&#39;t even get that right. Ed didn\&#39;t get that close and personal and scare people, he shot the two and only people, he killed. So, why do these movies lie and say &#34;BASED ON A TRUE STORY&#34;? This is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A joke and nothing more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I would like to add on to this. I did finish this oh so sad movie, and I personal would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no Mountains (for those who have never been in Wisconsin) and oh THERE IS NO DESERT! What the hell, there was more pine trees and snow in Ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in Californa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, for those who know nothing about Ed Gein, I would like to give you, your history lesson. Ed Gein was thought to have killed his family, but it was never proved. He killed a bartender, she was shot at bar close when no one was around. He took the DEAD bartender back to his house. 10 years later he SHOT and killed the store clerk, he stoled the cash register and the store truck. He was caught because of this murder, he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was in there buying the antifreeze, and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. He robbed graves, in fact in robbed 56 graves. He hate the people he dug up and he made furinture; lamp shades, couches, chairs, and other things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught, considering he was caught at their house. He was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car, in fear of what may happen to him. How do I know all of this? I read the book the judge that tried him wrote. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this movie was over, after watching the whole horrific thing, not only am I offended by the directors horriable view on what Wisconsin women look like. I mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time, you know cause Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is and I think he may be OK in something else, but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of this I am so sad I wasted the 3.99 on the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie after finished was completely untrue, this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and George Washington wasn\&#39;t our first president. Come on people, that is your history, and this is Wisconsin\&#39;s history. To end this rant, how would all of you feel if I made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think that is fine, but it would be not true) and he lived and wasn\&#39;t the president and whatever. You can\&#39;t rewrite history.&#39;

b&#39;In the dusty little town of Furlough in Texas, an animal is slaughtering the cattle and the locals. When the teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, their friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), her Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) finds that a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they plot a plan to kill the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Mexican Werewolf in Texas&#34; is an amateurish crap and among the worse movies I have ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the screenplay is laughable, with some of the most terrible lines I have ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the &#34;style&#34; of &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34;. The amateurish acting seems to be a prank of high-school students or a high school play. The &#34;special effects&#34; are gruesome and extremely poor and the &#34;werewolf&#34; is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood movies are cult, but this &#34;Mexican Werewolf in Texas&#34; is pure garbage. In the end, Jill says that no man can resist her teats (actually the most beautiful thing in this flick). But I believe the correct quote should be &#34;no man (or woman) can resist to watch this movie to the end&#34;. I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe most of the viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes running time. My vote is one (awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas&#34; (&#34;A Mexican Werewolf in Texas&#34;)&#39;

b&#34;I don&#39;t understand the many good reviews, here. I found the photography and scenery beautiful, and the two lead actors appealing, but there&#39;s little else here to recommend this movie. Most annoying are the fake Southern accents and badly written dialog. These do not sound like real people to me. Although it&#39;s refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility Griffith feels toward his mentally ill Aunt, grossly over-acted by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear. Yes, I understand that he&#39;s a drifter, but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all. This movie is worth a look, chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it, but it&#39;s slow moving and deeply flawed. A serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it, as the premise and story outline are promising.&#34;

b&#34;I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far, the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. This movie was made in 2003 and I&#39;ve seen movies made in the 60&#39;s with better special effects. I wish I could go into detail, but words can&#39;t describe how crappy this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $20! I pray that Chuck Norris never makes a movie again. Now If you think I&#39;m downing this movie because it has a Christian theme, you&#39;re wrong. I like the fact that IL&#39; Chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make God look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie? This whole film can be summed up in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.&#34;

b&#34;I was 12 when this film was released and adored it. The song&#39;s were inspiring and it made me feel good, watching it several time&#39;s at the cinema. I actually had the soundtrack album and played the song&#39;s over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26 years later...I&#39;m ashamed. Just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lot&#39;s but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it. It&#39;s very poorly directed in many places and considering it was Lionel Jeffries directing I really wanted to enjoy it. The character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good. I remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an old film yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that&#39;s why I thought it was good then. But that does not excuse it for it&#39;s poor acting, directing and sloppiness. The main child actor&#39;s voice seem&#39;s dubbed which is very distracting too. Can&#39;t quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made, all that it become was a weak film.&#34;

b&#34;Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino&#39;s worst film he has ever made. It&#39;s full of his usual ingredient&#39;s i.e. snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feel&#39;s deja-vu. The directing is typical Tarantino and nothing seem&#39;s new at all. It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it&#39;s just a war drama that isn&#39;t funny, nor brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds supposedly is Tarantino&#39;s tribute to Leone&#39;s Spaghetti western&#39;s but seem&#39;s mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw&#39;s the audience of balance.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;m no director or writer or anything related to a movie. But watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not. So here it is: The quick and the undead is a rip-off of the Quick and the Dead. I was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it. But oh no, I was really in for an very big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply the movie sucks. I&#39;m a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a big fan of zombies, watch this.

b&#34;When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it&#39;s more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It&#39;s simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn&#39;t! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it&#39;s hard to get worked up about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As recent spoof movies go, it&#39;s not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it&#39;s nowhere near good enough.&#34;

b&#39;While Watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard TV movie... though through out the picture the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot) are by the book and unoriginal... and with every one the movie KEPT GETTING WORSE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role as DJ Tanner on the hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing as a Possessed twenty something.. trying to avenge the Possesers Death. I believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Filming was trashy, and like I said the plot stale... though watching it I knew I was in for automatic cheese, I had NO idea how much worse this film could get...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep Filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for&#39;

b&#34;A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. It doesn&#39;t have the power or intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it doesn&#39;t ever extend its reach anyway. The acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. Some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it&#39;s just a movie - and a B minus one at that. There are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.&#34;

b&#39;This film is just as bad as &#34;The Birdman of Alcatraz&#34;. I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director\&#39;s intent to elevate the film\&#39;s subject, a societal outcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman\&#39;s life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news. I remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a grip people. Read the history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove around the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest; then abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it just took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here.&#39;

b&#34;I love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie I knew that it was going to be lousy. It was poorly acted and much too slow. On top of that it was very, very racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic. Sometimes putting in racial, ethnic and other types of slurs has a point, illustrating the bigotry that exists. In this movie there was no point to the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950&#39;s. Having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense. It didn&#39;t translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible. I don&#39;t know how the play was originally written but I can&#39;t believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don&#39;t waste your precious time on this one.&#34;

b&#34;Best thing I can say about this porno-horror film is: boobies boobies boobies !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, this film is made by some Hindu/Indian guy with some background in porn films or such .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: Talk-Show host and girlfriend are stalked by a psychopath who is angry over the plight of the homeless and takes it out on, you guessed it, beautiful real-estate agent ladies ! (films like these are why the slasher films of the 80&#39;s got a rep for misogyny)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is not really a Slasher, but has the same sort of implausibilities and stereotypes: the dumb-ass cops, the villain is an old white male, and the women are busty babes . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like porno-horror, this is your movie, otherwise stay away .

b&#34;Once upon a time Quentin Tarantino was a relatively successful filmmaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, unfortunately, he not only makes terrible films, but puts his names to ones like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A supposedly cool retro flashback to biker movies of the 60s and 70s, this plumbs new depths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe you me, I enjoy it when a blouse falls off in a film more than the next man but even I felt kind of sleazy watching this. To use a word I never thought I would, its msysoginistic (you see, I can&#39;t even spell it.) The plot (in the vaguest sense of the term) is as incomprehensible as Vinnie Jones&#39; accent, the fact his terrible acting does not stand our particularly is as damning a testament as one can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just terrible.

b&#34;It&#39;s just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It&#39;s not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&amp;A movie, this one is a turkey. Not even die hard low budget 80&#39;s films fans would want to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and plenty of bad acting. This film would have been better off never being released.

b&#34;There is something about Doug McLure&#39;s appearance in a movie that is a warranty of wretchedness. His DG initials are like a special cinema-certification, that comes somewhere before &#39;U&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer\xc2\xa0from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own. He did excellent work in the Hammer movies as Dr Van Helsing. I&#39;v seen him do a very passable Sherlock Holmes in &#39;Hound Of The Baskervilles&#39;. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first &#39;Star Wars&#39;. The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to &#39;stop bickering&#39; and get away with it.

And here&#39;s another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a machine that&#39;s been hijacked from Tracy Island. It&#39;s a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides. I&#39;m surprised Jerry Anderson didn&#39;t sue for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought-off. Yet if the movie is any guide, they can&#39;t have paid him much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s 1976 and we&#39;re still playing about in latex romper-suits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s about it really.

b&#34;Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun&#39;s Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well. The makeup, costumes and sound design are distractingly poor, and the battle scenes were substandard as well, inferior to other samurai films of earlier years (Seven Samurai comes to mind). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonny Chiba plays the Sonny Chiba character in Shogun&#39;s Samurai, the no-nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film, scowling menacingly. What a guy; he even gets to wear an eye patch. If you were expecting to see the legendary Toshiro Mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo, and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting, he disappears for good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the strengths of the film are its story, which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films, and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil. Two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father, who may have had some help on his way out. Early on, it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn&#39;t be more clearly good and evil; after all, the older brother stammers and has a birthmark, the sure sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it becomes clear that in a winner-takes-all struggle for power, there are no heroes and villains, only winners and losers.&#34;

b&#39;Jack Bender\&#39;s &#34;The Tempest&#34; is an adaption of Shakespeare\&#39;s play &#34;The Tempest&#34;. Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prospero, re-named Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter, a so-called &#34;Gator-Man&#34;, who later tries to rape Prospero\&#39;s daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero won\&#39;t accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero, finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero\&#39;s original authority and wisdom is not made clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------End of Part 1----------------------------&#39;

b&#34;We&#39;ve all got to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. In fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on June 25, 1945.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war on Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I&#39;m wondering why even back then the public didn&#39;t question why a Nazi spy ring was helping out the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater. The cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the OSS in that part of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#39;re an FBI man like William Wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like Nina Foch. He&#39;s about to go on a mission to the Orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. Germans who&#39;ve been bugging Otto Kruger&#39;s house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who&#39;ve already lost the war trying to help their allies. Who, by the way, they refer to as &#39;Japs&#39;. When Foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about Wright&#39;s danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and foils the plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the stuff you&#39;d expect from a nice noir film is there, the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit sets, Budd Boetticher tried his best as did the cast. But they just weren&#39;t convincing, probably because they didn&#39;t believe this claptrap themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s possible, but not likely that Nina Foch&#39;s dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor. I think it was just a lousy screenplay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Budd and Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here.&#34;

Despite all the running she does, she always arrives looking like she\&#39;s just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland, characterless screenplays but it\&#39;s a pointless exercise. &#34;Tru Calling&#34; just lies on the slab, gazing lifelessly at the ceiling.&#39;

b&#39;Words cannot describe how asinine, juvenile,and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is. It relies on 3 things: 1. Constant 80s pop culture references 2. the tired &#34;stretch out a joke to the point of awkwardness&#34; bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which I suppose elicit an &#34;OMG LOL THAT\&#39;S FROM SUPERFRIENDS!! THAT IS SO TOTALLY IRONIC, AND I AM SO EDGY AND SMART FOR GETTING IT!!&#34; response from the viewer. The writing is beyond lazy, and panders to its viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Plus there\&#39;s the character design, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and maybe a different hairline occasionally. Insulting crap.&#39;

b&#34;quite possibly one of (if not the) worst film ever conceived, cast and acted in the history of cinema. Who on God&#39;s green earth would ever think to cast Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother. God forgive me but I am just being honest. And that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film. It was a horrible statement against women but at least if you&#39;re gonna blame women for the problems of the world, tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills. Everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the DVD.&#34;

b&#34;THE ATTIC starts off well. The somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there&#39;s a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when Carrie Snodgress&#39; character buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a real big chimpanzee!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sudden plot device basically kills the movie. It&#39;s just not conceivable for a woman like the one Snodgress plays, who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father, for her to, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget about it!&#34;

b&#39;I cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. I\&#39;ve worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. I haven\&#39;t made a comment on IMDb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. It is a piece of sh*t. The writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager. The characters are unrealistic (The lead woman doesn\&#39;t think of taking the policeman\&#39;s pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a Molotov cocktail? please...) and not even likable, hell i hated her and cheered when she died. I don\&#39;t understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh*t with no real thought behind it to me. This is officially the worst movie I\&#39;ve seen ALL YEAR. Congratulations Shiban, you now rank up there with such greats as Micheal Bay in the prestigious &#34;shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film&#34; club. I hope you read this, i really do. And to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh oh my god I hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you.&#39;

b&#34;This is far the most worst film I&#39;ve seen this year from Bollywood so far. I may not lie, my wife liked this film very much. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal what made this film become unbelievable, but it was Amisha Patel. She performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where (luckily for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with. When I saw this film, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with her performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level in performing as an actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It is the clich\xc3\xa9 story. Sudden Arjun gets killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair, but then Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor in my point of view, but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries it deep into the ground. I must say Bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far. Bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him. He was so bad in acting in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe every word he says. Only a movie with high potential like a Yash Copra film has to meet his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, someones enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this crap? I don&#39;t. Why didn&#39;t they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and give Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I&#39;m sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like Bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves so much better than a movie with Amisha (bigscreen t.v. face) Patel. This movie was so awful, that I regret buying it.&#34;

b&#34;Yes, I couldn&#39;t stop yawning, nor could my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours - and I&#39;m not even a fan of action films, but this just falls asleep on its feet - unless you are a 70&#39;s polo neck sweater fan! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you were expecting ANYTHING to happen, don&#39;t hold your breath - it doesn&#39;t! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher. It&#39;s like a long, boring and rather disjointed dream. Frederic floats through it, able to leave work whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly. Obviously not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files - just a giant calendar to let you know that the film really is taking 6 months to watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion, neither does his wife, and the children behave like rag dolls - in stark contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong views, never gives the appearance of really feeling anything. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple overseen in a cafe, and have nothing to do with the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it&#39;s entertainment, or even good cinematography you are looking for, I think this film is incredibly over-rated by most other viewers.&#34;

b&#34;Dr. Chopper starts shortly after teenager Nicholas&#39; (Robert Adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining &amp; in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at Lake Tatonka the self proclaimed &#39;friendly place for happy people&#39; that she didn&#39;t tell him about. So Nicholas together with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) &amp; three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) &amp; Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) head out there for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things don&#39;t go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed &amp; their neighbours turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) &amp; his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going straight-to-video/DVD Dr. Chopper was edited &amp; directed by Lewis Schoenburn &amp; this film seems to be having a hard time here on the IMDb with some pretty harsh reviews, while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless I don&#39;t think some of the criticism I&#39;ve read is entirely justified. The script which takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the IMDb cast list although I can&#39;t remember any character of that name, maybe he was one of the cops at the start? Anyway, the basic story is alright I suppose although it&#39;s a tad dull &amp; lasts for too long, it&#39;s typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying American teen cast, you know the drill by now. Besides some brief &amp; undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there&#39;s not much story here &amp; the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off, there&#39;s the inevitable sex scenes, there&#39;s a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless &amp; there&#39;s even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. Oh, &amp; when I say topless I mean they aren&#39;t wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn&#39;t any actual full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper at all. So there you have it really, it&#39;s an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clich\xc3\xa9d dumb character&#39;s that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes &amp; girls in bras. To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe I&#39;m just being picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Schoenburn does OK actually, this is by no means the worst looking film I&#39;ve seen although it still looks cheap. There&#39;s no style here, I didn&#39;t think it was scary &amp; there&#39;s no atmosphere either. The gore is restrained &amp; restricted to some dead bodies &amp; severed limbs, there&#39;s nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions &amp; motivations are ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room &amp; the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. The acting is alright, it could have better but I&#39;ve certainly seen worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn&#39;t enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.&#34;

b&#34;Why was this film made? What were the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8MM film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the snuff film industry. This sequel is about... hold on... the porno industry!! Yes, as if the snuff film industry, an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment, were at all in the same league with the adult film industry, an industry in which people film other people engaging in unstimulated sex acts and situations for eroticism. The idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is. It isn&#39;t helped by a lack of plot, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme, or even sound design. This is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention. Literally nothing works. Why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway? I don&#39;t have much of an interest in adult films, but I certainly have watched them before. Why would somebody make a film about the evils of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies? I don&#39;t even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making, but I hope it doesn&#39;t. The idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it. I don&#39;t think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I&#39;m pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people. It is never okay to hurt another human being. The adult film industry isn&#39;t about hurting people. It&#39;s about creating films that are, to me, a diversion and a waste of time. What is this film trying to say? It doesn&#39;t work.&#34;

b&#39;In 1904 Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and, by doing so, kidnap &#34;American pestilence&#34;, which attracts the attention of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of &#34;The King and I&#34; interjected, besides). Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue, and both seem singularly without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don\&#39;t know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurry, noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but a loser to John Williams\&#39; &#34;Jaws&#34;), fine location shooting and cinematography. *1/2 from ****&#39;

b&#34;I would not recommend it whatsoever. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn&#39;t leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn&#39;t take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except The two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did smack of Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers. You know what I mean. blablabla. The filming was grainy and just a very low quality. There was nobody in that theater that liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.&#34;

b&#34;I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and distasteful I don&#39;t think Dr Seuss would have approved.How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice.&#34;

I guess when it\&#39;s Bruce Campbell I need to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn\&#39;t seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s sad, too, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70\&#39;s and 80\&#39;s, I just can\&#39;t believe movies this bad are still being made. Bruce, I\&#39;m really disappointed.&#39;

b&#39;This movie was, in one word, terrible. It was boring, predictable, and downright creepy. I kept waiting for it to end and when it did, I was horrified.

Movies like this give classics like Lolita a bad name.&#39;

Besides, this is boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the original is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas.

b&#34;Bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film. The kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are splatted everywhere, so much so that you really aren&#39;t supposed to see them as human. The yawns between the lines from Wayans and Sandler are extensive indeed. They try hard but , alas and alack, persona itself does not a good film make. Jimmy Caan plays a nifty villain but he&#39;s always had that redneck edge at the ready. My favorite&#39;s scene is the repeated clips of a TV ad in which Caan reveals the virtues of America can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage. Aside from that it&#39;s a buddy movie with guns for brains. Pass on this one.&#34;

b&#39;Not since &#34;8 Heads in a Duffel Bag&#34; and the &#34;How High&#34; previews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have I laughed so little at something that the film makers thought&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would be hysterical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as 4-F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of about half a dozen. He then impersonates a Nazi commander in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Italy, and eventually tries to kill Hitler. That is the description of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;flimsy plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes &#34;Hogan\&#39;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heroes&#34; look like Shakespeare. If the money men of &#34;The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Producers&#34; had really wanted to lose their cash, they should have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shown this film. I cannot stress how bad this thing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lewis\&#39; direction consists of two different cameras shooting the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;action from two different angles, then being edited together. This&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sitcom type of direction works on television, but here it is an&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;obvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of his&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to double&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over in stitches before going to the next tired set up. I spent most of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;severe flatulence, over this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone wears the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;latest style and has the latest interior design...for 1970. The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;supporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on his patented tangents,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final embarassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;put one over on the Japanese. They wear buck teeth, squint their&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eyes, and talk in a &#34;funny&#34; accent. It may be one of the most&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. I was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;slack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing, but that put&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me over the edge. Watch for Kaye Ballard\&#39;s very tasteless scene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Star Trek&#34;\&#39;s George Takei has two small scenes, then wisely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;drops out of the picture. This has less laughs than Mel Brooks\&#39; last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;three films combined. There is nothing sadder than watching a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;actually feel ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned that with &#34;The&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic,&#34; but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while pulling the same unfunny schtick. I feel sorry for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Which Way to the Front?&#34; is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though rated (G), this contains some physical violence, some gun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;violence, and some adult situations.

b&#34;From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought &#39;I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place. The storyline was mediocre and I suppose, like most films, If the rest had been done well it would have stood up. I don&#39;t usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating (must be cast/crew) I felt I had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack.&#34;

b&#34;This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods &#39;Judas Priest&#39; and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to front a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the &#39;safe&#39; middle of the road &#39;Rock Star&#39; to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of &#39;heavy metal&#39; go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio &amp; Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.&#34;

b&#34;So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn&#39;t seen or even heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.&#34;

b&#39;By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive &#34;music&#34; hammering away at the bewildered victims, big &#34;surprises&#34; (which actually tend to be about as &#34;revelatory&#34; as The National Enquirer\&#39;s headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you\&#39;ve already impressed the crowds. This movie\&#39;s totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (For by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without &#34;Oldboy&#34;s vulgar excesses, I recommend an older Dutch/French movie, &#34;The Vanishing&#34;.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, don\&#39;t believe there\&#39;s absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. In fact there is. The (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a &#34;hero&#34;, an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad the poor beast, having been eaten, couldn\&#39;t survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the &#34;best actor&#34;, at the Cannes festival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which festival, by the way, between Moore\&#39;s propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sic transit gloria mundi!&#39;

b&#39;I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself. The premise is right on cue--a confused &amp; disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused &amp; disordered young individuals. But the director\&#39;s weak swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark, and it leaves us, the audience, feeling confused &amp; disordered. Bravo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European &#34;American Pie&#34; flick, then I\&#39;d be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the &#34;inner self&#34; vs. the &#34;public self&#34; (one\&#39;s &#34;mother tongue&#34; vs. one\&#39;s &#34;secondary language&#34;). Furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. Off to an interesting start, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG. That\&#39;s as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director\&#39;s way of floundering to get back on topic. It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, &#34;So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest &amp; making ape noises at one point) whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling French people &#34;frogs&#34; and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isn\&#39;t a deep or well-thought out film. It\&#39;s simply an Anglophobe\&#39;s retort to the Anglophiles. But really it\&#39;s no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there\&#39;s a funny irony to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, philosophy, artistry &amp; socio-political commentary aside, I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls\&#39; boyfriends, but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I\&#39;d like to brush up on my French &amp; Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans may be stupid, but we do try.)&#39;

b&#39;Back in 2002 when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If The Comebcaks had been released in March (as planned) the same time TMNT was released, TMNT would\&#39;ve won by default! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, Matthew Lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback. He didn\&#39;t have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus. But when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl\&#39;s boob, those were the minuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video, except Matthew Lawrence (insert The Price Is Right\&#39;s losing horns)! Another blown musical opportunity for him, just because he\&#39;s shy about doing music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, Matt has disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, Joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and Andrew\&#39;s starting a music career of his own. But it\&#39;s very rare to find a Matt musical moment. The two that stand out would be on Brotherly Love where he played the guitar and sang &#34;Pigeon On Your Car&#34; (Art Atrack), which he wrote by the way, and that romantic Boy Meets World moment when he sang &#34;This Dame&#34; (As Time Goes By).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt, you\&#39;ve played jocks too long. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.&#39;

b&#39;I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don\&#39;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start? Okay..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No ricochet. Metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Magic bullets? In one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good-guy right in front of him doesn\&#39;t get hurt at all! 4) After having just splattered a human being all over the wall, the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Sound? At one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). The lady screams out &#34;Alarm in sector blah blah&#34; and the bad-guy boss says &#34;Okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah&#34; in a very, very amateur kinda way. Ooh, we\&#39;re getting ambushed by terrorists, this isn\&#39;t a drill, but I\&#39;m gonna sound like I don\&#39;t give crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Focus!! First you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. For some reason the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or loop of scenes? You literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. The weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. XX locks and loads. When they started opening fire you HAD to see the barrel flashes. Boooring!! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they\&#39;re smoke-blind or something so they don\&#39;t see it coming. They cough and moan as if it was Anthrax in the grenade. Then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn\&#39;t even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn\&#39;t Anthrax anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) B flick? I think yeah! A guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a Uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. I\&#39;d like to see a guy fire a Uzi with one hand and I\&#39;d like to see him go get his hand afterwards. Extra bloody gore mess in a B flick kinda way. Small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. Though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) One of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! How stupid can you be!? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes, the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. Cut to the action if you\&#39;re going for a B flick movie, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two cents on this movie.&#39;

b&#34;o dear god i suffered having to watch this film FOUR times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it Ja Rule just proved he cannot act Ving Rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn&#39;t good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful&#34;

b&#39;Makes &#34;Invasion USA&#34; look like &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34;. This one can only be recommended to US skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple : let\&#39;s shoot them all - gooks, commies, latinos, everything that isn\&#39;t American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, this is badly acted, badly scripted, badly interpreted, incredibly stupid but no fun at all. This movie could be used as a toorture device by CIA torturers. oops, sorry, there can\&#39;t be any US torturers because they are the GOOD&#39;

b&#39;Well, I didn\&#39;t know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact, I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80\&#39;s slasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death. After this, he proceeds to rape the dead corpse. The police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on. How will they find the killer? Does anybody care?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I have ever seen. No wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else, literally. The three lead actors consist of two detectives and a &#34;sexy&#34; female reporter. I am being sarcastic when I say sexy, she is about as un-sexy as it gets. The two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. One of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. The acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie, thus almost putting you to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes. For a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects, which still aren\&#39;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there, I would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4/10&#39;

b&#39;I got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid. I\&#39;d rented the second one and it was a decent &#34;B&#34; sci-fi. This one was out right obnoxious. The &#34;special&#34; effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. The two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they came on the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I don\&#39;t know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but I\&#39;m sure that they\&#39;d have done better to have left it at 2 movies. The movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device.&#39;

b&#39;Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and sidekick Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are itinerant cowpunchers who can\&#39;t seem to stay in one place very long. In &#34;Helltown&#34;, the boys are headed to Montana, where they meet up with Rudd\&#39;s cousin Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It\&#39;s a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd, although Dare becomes self conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) rides into camp. Judy is Tom\&#39;s girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident early on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fillmore has a cattle herd to move, and promotes Dare to running the drive, partly to prove to Judy that he may not be up to the task. Meanwhile, bad guy Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) has his eyes on Fillmore\&#39;s cattle, but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd, he figures it\&#39;s easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the trail. Conning Dare into a rigged card game with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare\&#39;s money begins to evaporate hand after hand. It\&#39;s only when Dare fails to show up back at Fillmore\&#39;s ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin. Exposing the cheats, Tom, Dare and Dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Helltown&#34;, also known as &#34;Born to the West&#34;, was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne\&#39;s series of Westerns for Lone Star Productions. It only slightly alters the Lone Star formula; Wayne does get the girl at the end of the film, but here he was trying. There\&#39;s a great runaway horse scene where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, in which Johnny Mack Brown\&#39;s horse does a complete somersault spill. Syd Saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. He replaces familiar faces George &#34;Gabby&#34; Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, staples of the Lone Star films. John Wayne\&#39;s charisma is beginning to develop here, preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Helltown&#34; was based on a novel by legendary Western author Zane Grey. If you\&#39;re looking for more films based on Grey\&#39;s stories, try &#34;Fighting Caravans&#34; with Gary Cooper, &#34;The Light of Western Stars&#34; with Victor Jory, &#34;Drift Fence&#34; with Buster Crabbe, and &#34;Heritage of the Desert&#34; with Randolph Scott.&#39;

b&#34;The director does not know what to do with a camera... too many options and she always always always picks the wrong one... she let travolta take charge... and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end... the characters are not developed... maybe because we need to watch them singing... no pace at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow... miscasted: travolta OK... johansson, she is too grown up to be a 18... even if she is really 20...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the happy ending? well it looks like that there must be one, so the story is sad but not too sad... travolta doesn&#39;t know how to play a guitar but the director doesn&#39;t look she cares too much that he is totally out of synch... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the idea is the only thing that is great... but how she developed it? well, it is simply full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad, another missed chance...&#34;

b&#39;This movie had potential. The script was not bad, and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regrets, and--as Chris says--&#34;10 years of going nowhere&#34;. It\&#39;s a sharp contrast to the original MAG7 which was bright, humorous, and even the bad guy was lovable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a very interesting change of tone, and if they had developed the characters more, maybe I would\&#39;ve liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. At one point you see a horse fall, and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But not many people would notice that, since there are already 2 dozen horse trips (I\&#39;m not exaggerating), and by then we\&#39;ve already dozed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to the title of my review. This film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty, so chances are (if you decide to watch it) you\&#39;ll get the watered down, kiddie version. There\&#39;s a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering, there\&#39;s no bull, just the matador in an empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I dunno. More likely, the scene was cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later there\&#39;s a cockfight scene where, in the original version, one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering Mexicans. This was cut. But we still see enough to get pretty annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But by far the worst scenes are the horse throws. One after the other, you see horses\&#39; legs get yanked, sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head. In one scene, a horse gets thrown, and then while it\&#39;s squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive goes off right under its neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was made in 1966 when Hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film. This is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen. So if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat, check it out &amp; you\&#39;ll get a mild thrill. But if not, you\&#39;ll either be irritated or flat out bored.&#39;

b&#34;My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don&#39;t want to watch something that really requires thought but don&#39;t want to go to bed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn&#39;t even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. Everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped Pinocchio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER: The ending goes a step or two too far, complete with the clich\xc3\xa9 not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there&#39;s a shot of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it&#39;s a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film, you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat. Don&#39;t pay for it but if you&#39;re in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right.&#34;

b&#39;I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man\xc2\x85 but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, \&#39;Nana (1926),\&#39; this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn\&#39;t have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated &#34;Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land).&#34; An African explorer \xc2\x96 played by Johnny Huggins, a Black man dressed up as a White man dressed up as a Black man, if you follow me \xc2\x96 travels to the ruins of Paris in his spherical aircraft, and lands outside the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director\&#39;s wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume I\&#39;ve ever seen. The savage, as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual, starts showing the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn\&#39;t help the film that Hessling, who was wonderful the following year in Renoir\&#39;s \&#39;The Little Match Girl (1928),\&#39; isn\&#39;t much of a dancer, though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I\&#39;m quite shocked that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object \xc2\x96 it doesn\&#39;t come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later! On the plus side, I did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this. However, why Renoir decided to dress up his Black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time. Silly, crude and quite pointless, \&#39;Charleston Parade (1927)\&#39; is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema\&#39;s most respected directors, and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of pieces from Dmitri Shostakovich.&#39;

b&#34;This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C&amp;W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, creepy former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. Fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it&#39;s her wedding day. The leper bride is horny, bu Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape the castle, but the Count and his slave chase them with dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they&#39;re both lepers now. They live for years in the castle...Fallon&#39;s hair turns gray and Cassandra goes bonkers. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our tale of love and leprosy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bizarre it&#39;s watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.&#34;

b&#34;Let me break down this film for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. I&#39;m not one to nitpick about special effects, but what you&#39;ve got to understand is that if you can&#39;t afford good special effects, you shouldn&#39;t anchor your film around special effects. Starships fire blobs of color at each other, flaring into stock explosions, and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers. You will have no idea what is happening. It will not make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be treated to drab scenery, and illogical, boring fight scenes. Nobody speaks. Nothing interesting happens. The protagonist&#39;s goals are unclear, and are not very compelling. This goes on for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in a five-minute montage, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps herself to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last twenty minutes, basically the chick&#39;s memories get transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of mankind. After this, we see the first, and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe is collapsing, you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She chooses yes. BUT THE MEMORIES OF MANKIND SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we won&#39;t make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. The lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand. All of the story is told through painfully dull narration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas. There are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films, but as it stands, it&#39;s bloated with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage. Instead, the narrator fills in a novella&#39;s worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good ideas in here, but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained. People watched films to be entertained. This film does not entertain.&#34;

b&#34;Well, I&#39;m a huge fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought this on DVD off of eBay for my boyfriends birthday. We sat down to watch it and it was so boring. I don&#39;t remember laughing once. It&#39;s only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end. Elizabeth is great in this though. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a big Elizabeth Berkley fan though. If she wasn&#39;t in it I wouldn&#39;t have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up. Unfortunately even Elizabeth couldn&#39;t save this film. Just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you&#39;d rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life. It&#39;s a very forgetful film.&#34;

b&#34;In a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into &#39;adult&#39; films, Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. True, it&#39;s got every cliche in the book in it, silly fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly- it&#39;s got Elizabeth McGovern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a John Hughes film, she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but McGovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty. The &#39;teen film&#39; fun that worked so well in other Hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he&#39;d find some new material. But I keep going back to McGoverns performance, because it&#39;s truly moving. Mr. Hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent, some wonderful things can happen. If only he&#39;d trust that it doesn&#39;t have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff.&#34;

b&#39;Obvious tailored vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he\&#39;s eternally 16 (he can\&#39;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends to Phillippe, but when they\&#39;re not on the screen Phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s TV cop shows, such as &#34;The Streets of San Francisco.&#34; Snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain, playing a slightly less crazed madman than his Demolition Man role. However, there wasn\&#39;t much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Statham\&#39;s character announces he\&#39;d given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly forgettable moment: Ryan Phillippe expounding on Buddhist dogma: Galloway: Are you a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It\&#39;s just something I picked up along the way.&#39;

b&#39;OK, it was a &#34;risky&#34; move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to &#34;Bloodsurf&#34;, the worst &#34;horrormovie&#34; I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn\&#39;t to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it. Stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a &#34;cult classic&#34;. It most definitely do not deserve any recognition.&#39;

While having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio&#39;s sister. With the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. At first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. But then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug&#39;s sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they&#39;re pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can&#39;t defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course, there&#39;s the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. Right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn&#39;t been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a Rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. It&#39;s completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can&#39;t accuse it of not being consistent. So, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn&#39;t exist, check out the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie.. etc. Notice a pattern emerging here? Their careers all hit dead ends. Why? Sit through this, and all will become clear. Remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please.. 3/10&#34;

b&#34;I haven&#39;t for a long time seen such a horrible film. I hoped that at least Adam Sandler could be funny... hopeless. Seems, like some teenager have written it&#39;s script and he&#39;s daddy pushed this so far, that someone agreed to shoot it. (Movie)World could be better place without this, whatever it is.&#34;

b&#39;My website (theflickguy.org) lists &#34;Michael&#34; as one of the worst films of the modern era. The following is an excerpt: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Everyone slums some time in their lives, this was Travolta\&#39;s turn. I still don\&#39;t know what the point of this terrible film was. Nora Efron has proved to be a competent writer and director, so what the hell happened here? The Archangel Michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham-fisted, chain-smoking sugar addicted fornicating slob whose biggest contribution to humanity (after sending Lucifer to hell) was that he invented &#34;standing in line&#34;. Yes, how funny and charming. I don\&#39;t find this offensive, I find it stupid. In its defense, I can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;Is this a game FMV or a movie? In all honesty, I watched this one out of &#34;choice-less-ness&#34;. It is a very big waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems HK movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch, rather than something you want us to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games (in comparison to today\&#39;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s\&#39; Wing Commander game, namely the third installment of the series. Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest histories, the myths and the legends, the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what went so very very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films?! Please stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK movies are heading downhill so rapidly. Didn\&#39;t you claim to be the Hollywood of the Orient? Guess not.&#39;

b&#34;Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies I have ever seen. Seemed like a made-for-TV movie. And a bad one at that. I cannot believe that people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing John Sayles to make films. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and got so bored with it, we ended up cleaning the house while it was on . . . and it still bored us! It made me think that critics have been so gullible with Sayles&#39; previous films, such as Lone Star, which was raved about at he time but didn&#39;t really add up to much in the end. Spend your time on something better. Anything.&#34;

b&#34;&#39;R Xmas is one of the only films I&#39;ve seen where I can almost say that simply nothing happens.I felt as though I watched a drug dealing middle- class couple,with child,walk around,eat,smoke,converse(excuse me,swear)through most of the film.And I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m missing the point.I think this film was well directed,well acted(although the husband&#39;s performance was rather wooden),and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved.But when the dust clears,your left with zero(just a boat-load of fade outs).I didn&#39;t want car chases,gun violence,beatings,etc.In fact,I&#39;m sick of violence.But my goodness,let&#39;s at least get a bit deeper into all these characters(let&#39;s get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better-not just show glancing shots of them as street thugs).Why was the dialogue so juvenile? Everyone spoke as if they were in junior high.I believe even this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _,sh_ _,etc.The pacing and the storyline of &#39;R Xmas I found quite interesting,but the execution was plain and simple-empty.4/10&#34;

b&#34;This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she enlisted other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends -- certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not a knee-jerk fan of French film, but Ma Vie en Rose is a subtle, thoughtful, and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would love to see it get wider exposure among English-speaking audiences -- and if that means an American re-make, so be it. But puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues AND the intelligence of the audience -- and better direction for the actors, who couldn&#39;t seem to decide if they were working for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!&#34;

b&#34;Oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the Moon. The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the Moon, but it didn&#39;t quite add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected them to be. All in all, a great disappointment.&#34;

b&#39;This film took up three hours, including commercials, on the History International Channel last night. But it felt like three weeks. It wasn\&#39;t the cheap, stagy and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of Dresden. It wasn\&#39;t that the film is stripped of almost all context surrounding World War II. It wasn\&#39;t even that the bombing itself was often made to appear as nothing more than a major inconvenience for a goofy love story. No, it was the wooden featureless characterizations that sucked the life out of the story. Oh, and the fact that if it is possible for a movie to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would have been DRESDEN--AS URIAH HEEP WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is especially the latter point that so irritates. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The makers of this movie believe so. But in the typically emasculated way that Germans have come to approach World War II, they can\&#39;t bring themselves to say so without braying about &#34;peace&#34; and &#34;no more wars--anywhere&#34; like they\&#39;re Mother Teresa. And, also typical of German obsequiousness towards the British in particular, there is an unwieldy effort to grovel before &#34;Britishness&#34;, while loading all the &#34;guilt&#34; for Dresden on to one person, Arthur Harris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I say one person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the movie, there is an exclamation from the leading character, Anna, with whom we are all supposed to sympathize. &#34;Damned Americans!&#34;, she screams, while watching as far off bombs fall. And a few minutes later, a radio voice intones warnings about the &#34;American Terror Bombing&#34; being inflicted upon Germans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the word, &#34;terror&#34;. Got that? It\&#39;s really the Americans behind the inhumane targeting of German civilians. No matter that the American strategy for almost all the war in Europe was the &#34;precision&#34; bombing of industrial and war manufacturing sites. No matter that it was the British who enthusiastically adopted &#34;area&#34; bombing of civilian targets in Germany--before the Germans had themselves even targeted English ones. No matter that the Americans bombed during the day, suffering more casualties in the process than the British, in order to hit precision targets, while the British bombed civilians under the cover of night. No matter that the Americans, essentially, were brought into the RAF\&#39;s true terror bombing campaign kicking and screaming against it. No matter that most American officials, from FDR to Gen. Dolittle, opposed targeting civilians, while Churchill and his generals couldn\&#39;t wait to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, in DRESDEN, both the Germans and British, except for &#34;Bomber&#34; Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, it is intimated, created by the evil Americans. And only the might and power of a love story between a German nurse and a downed British bomber pilot can adequately explain the &#34;truth&#34; of the atrocity. Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, for the younger and likely less well read readers of IMDb, the first and still so far only major literary effort to give a thoughtful voice to Dresden\&#39;s bombing was the pacifist novel penned by Kurt Vonnegut--an American POW in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I guess Germany\&#39;s ZDF couldn\&#39;t find a pretty nurse for Billy Pilgrim.&#39;

b&#39;Apart from some quite stunning scenery, this Steven Seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it.

b&#34;Granny, directed by Boris Pavlovsky (who?), sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho-killer dressed in a old hag rubber mask and a nightdress interrupts their party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover, but it appears that the same is not true of DVDs: I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror film last night, and since the cover of Granny featured a shoddily photo-shopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe, terrible typography (they even use the system font Sand, a definite design no-no!), and credits featuring absolutely no-one I had heard of, I reckoned it would be pretty lousy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a film clocks in at just under an hour long, it really shouldn&#39;t waste too much time before getting to the action; Granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation. Anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin (and I doubt most sane people would bother) will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore, loads of awful acting, and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise (if you&#39;ve seen April Fool&#39;s Day, then you&#39;ll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granny is uninspired, unexciting, and almost unwatchable.

b&#39;This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it is a little different from many I have seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes, but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type. Because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut-outs. Just slightly. I had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment, they find a handgun. &#34;Thank you, God!&#34; one of them happily exclaims. That guy\&#39;s head suddenly looks like a mannequin\&#39;s head, and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder, &#34;What is that? Where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?&#34; Then BOOM! The head explodes and I figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun. I love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;m a fan of good, plausible, action movies. And I\&#39;m a huge fan of the elite military units such as the Navy SEALs. Finally, I\&#39;m a huge fan of Michael Biehn. Sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time. I gave it another chance more recently when I bought the DVD. Here\&#39;s the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. It\&#39;s a poor mans top gun, for example including a virtual music video of the SEAL team playing golf with a soundtrack of &#34;The Boys are Back In Town&#34;, which concludes with Charlie Sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This is quite simply a Charlie Sheen movie, when Sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like Hot Shots. Reports I\&#39;ve heard indicate that Sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and Direction the rest of the actors in the movie got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team yet Sheen seldom obeys him. Any SEAL showing the lack of discipline that Sheen\&#39;s character does, or who endangered the team as he does, wouldn\&#39;t even have made it through BUDS training let alone gotten on a team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. SEALs are cross trained on weapons. Yet in one part of the movie a SEAL has to &#34;figure out&#34; how to use a U.S. Stinger Missile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few good scenes in the movie. The assault entry at the beginning, Bill Paxton as &#34;God&#34;, and some of the footage in what was supposed to be Beirut at the time. Overall though this movie is a loser.&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;m not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive Bigfoot. There has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor one that creates any real suspense. Both &#34;Legend of Boggy Creek&#34; (1972) and the first film entitled &#34;Sasquatch&#34; (1978) have become minor cult classics, but neither were very memorable. Both films were targeted at family friendly audiences, thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone. &#34;Harry &amp; The Hendersons&#34; (1987) was the first big budgeted film to use Bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by Rick Baker. However, they too chose to aim for younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (as did &#34;Bigfoot&#34; in 1995). I\&#39;ve long awaited for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of &#34;Jaws&#34; or &#34;Predator&#34;. When I saw this at my local video store I thought my dream had come true. Boy, was I wrong! Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains. The premise is interesting and sounded promising. The truth is it never builds any real suspense. I never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland. Even the always dependable Henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance. Every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored. He should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film. As for the creature, where do I start? I figured at the very least we would get a cool looking monster running around in the woods, but instead we get this bald (yes, I said &#34;bald!&#34;) man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there. Picture a cross between &#34;Swamp Thing&#34; and Chaka from &#34;Land of the Lost&#34; and you\&#39;ll get the idea. Nothing like the artwork on the cover box I assure you. Sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose). They even stole the whole infra-red vision P.O.V from the creature in &#34;Predator&#34;, which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective. Maybe all this proves is that Hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore Bigfoot films, as they have yet to make one that works. So far each one has been as scary as an episode of &#34;In Search Of&#34; 3/10&#39;

b&#39;This film plays like a demented episode of VH1\&#39;s &#34;Where Are They Now&#34;, or &#34;Behind The Music&#34;. In the first half of the movie (that depict his &#34;glory days&#34;) Abbie Hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star. You know the kind; the poseur lead singer, the pretty boy, who didn\&#39;t write any of the music, doesn\&#39;t have a clue, but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free. Consequently he takes his success for granted, abuses it, and ultimately destroys it along with himself. Indeed Hoffman\&#39;s glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine, skipped bail, and went into hiding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding. In it we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone, anyone, but himself for his downfall. Eventually the times pass him by completely; and he can never to come to grips with that. How sad. THE END. End credits roll and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for Hoffman in making this movie. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I\&#39;m sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all, an icon of the 60\&#39;s and of the Left\&#39;s anti-war movement. In this they have failed miserably. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a mindless caricature. We are never told about what drives him. How did he arrive at his views? How did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation? How did he organize such a vast movement? Why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine? Why? Who knows, and since the filmmakers don\&#39;t seem to, ultimately who cares?&#39;

b&#39;1989 was already a year in where Eddie Murphy wasn\&#39;t that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten. Funnily enough, it was also the year in where Murphy directed his first film, but it also would be the first and last experiment. &#34;Harlem nights&#34; wasn\&#39;t exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don\&#39;t blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy-laugh. The worst thing from &#34;Harlem nights&#34; are both the scenario and its terrible decors. Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie aren\&#39;t guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch &#34;Harlem Nights&#34; that\&#39;s for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name Murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.&#39;

b&#39;I disagree with Dante portraying the Democrat-supporting zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower IQ than that, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ... A single-digit figure, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MOH series is quite uneven, and this is the very worst episode. Dante, yet another mindless Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the Leftist establishment in order to re-kindle his pitiful career?), must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now, hence came up with this cringe-inducing, unsubtle, left-wing &#34;satire&#34; of the Bush administration, Republicans, and capitalism. Perhaps he felt he hadn\&#39;t been overtly political before. He wouldn\&#39;t exactly be the first no-talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career, when all else fails. The maker of turds such as &#34;Piranha&#34;, &#34;The Howling&#34;, and &#34;Matinee&#34;, Dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler had been to world peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TH uses lowest-common-denominator humour, cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue-collar union members wouldn\&#39;t have trouble understanding. Or have you ever seen a clever, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? Populist manure has the basest of all messages, hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as Sean Penn\&#39;s name. And what better people to send this message to the popcorn-munching sheep than a couple of cocaine-sniffing Tinseltown losers who\&#39;ve all fallen so low that they\&#39;re forced to write for TV...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want political propaganda, either Left or Right, in any type of movie. But placing it in horror - of all genres - is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among Hollywood\&#39;s anti-intelligentsia. So vapid was Dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote Democrat... (That\&#39;s what you get for finishing a movie school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination.)&#39;

b&#39;I registered with IMDb.com just so i could comment about this movie. My god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was! It shouldn\&#39;t even be touted as a real movie, this is very deceiving. this is a 15 year old\&#39;s film project at best. The acting is terrible. But even good actors could not save this. The dialog is probably the worst part of this movie. Who the hell wrote this crap? And that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about Kaye being a &#34;damsel in distress&#34; got old real fast. God i\&#39;d rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again. Do not rent this movie. If they gave you the movie for free do not watch it. smash it with a hammer. Even if smashing this video caused you to lose your Hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it. this is an abomination. I suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant. any questions....email me.&#39;

b&#39;I hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in \&#39;Shuttle\&#39; happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, &#34;Good call.&#34; In a very \&#39;Hostel\&#39;-type film, but more realistic \xc2\x96 as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you\&#39;re a pretty young woman, that is \xc2\x96 \&#39;Shuttle\&#39; was a decent film, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And aside from the typical &#34;tie him up&#34; instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those, it\&#39;s enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, that\&#39;s original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a &#34;too-good-to-be-true&#34; half-price shuttle ride. Clich\xc3\xa9d jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck\&#39;s stunt double from \&#39;Speed.\&#39; From here, it\&#39;s obvious what happens (I did mention it was a \&#39;Hostel\&#39; knock off) but still, I didn\&#39;t find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. Though, it would\&#39;ve served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.&#39;

b&#34;The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy. At any rate, he&#39;s in need of a haircut, badly, distractingly badly. Hockey hair does not belong in a WWII movie. Oh, and he&#39;s a racist. He doesn&#39;t want to share quarters with the &#39;negros&#39;. Of course in real life, he wouldn&#39;t want to share quarters with the white enlisted guy either. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause about officers quarters and enlisted but that wasn&#39;t the point here. Oh well, I think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick. He gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air pump for the divers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once you get going, it&#39;s not a bad story line. The japs want the divers to raise the silver thrown out by the Americans before Corrigador fell. The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And the POWs do their best to help. A potentially good story and not that badly done I guess. A bit unbelievable when the POWs use camp made re-breathers to swim between the POW camp and the Filipino village, every night. Maybe I&#39;m not that picky when I know going in that this is not a blockbuster film. I guess that&#39;s why it comes on a 20-pack DVD war movie collection for five bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 70s music did not belong in this movie or any WWII movie. It&#39;s quite distracting to say the least. The acting was not that bad. Probably better than I could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not somebody Richard Pryor made up. That in itself was worth the 25\xc2\xa2 I paid for this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth watching on TCM or paying a quarter for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for being a war movie, another for being WWII and one more because I&#39;m feeling generous.&#34;

b&#39;People call a 976 &#34;party line&#34; to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don\&#39;t discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who\&#39;s hot for her (or anyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he\&#39;s the first to discover one of the siblings\&#39; victims. He\&#39;s teamed with a female assistant of the District Attorney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing too special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief. One of the dirty-talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced Peanuts character Peppermint Patty! According to the IMDb, the other died quite young, just several years after this movie: sad.&#39;

b&#34;Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn&#39;t believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps&#39; past affected his (or anyone else&#39;s) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn&#39;t be there. Obviously, the director didn&#39;t know this rule and, so, stuffed his &#39;work&#39; with one dire scene after another. Even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn&#39;t a surprise, but it was unexpected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (1st Dec 2002), even though many people say it is one of their favourite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason being that there simply aren&#39;t any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your time watching this, watch a plank warp instead.&#34;

b&#34;A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton)stumble onto the town of Gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they&#39;re separated and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of King&#39;s best short stories. In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful. Also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute. There is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up. The kids are woefully unconvincing also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5 Matt Bronson&#34;

b&#39;In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called &#34;stickers&#34;. TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let\&#39;s say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting. The actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, sound way too memorized, as if this was a read-out camera test.&#39;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>

<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
Review-1: 
"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of "pernicious violence" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever "deserved" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway."
RESPONSE: Your review was NEGATIVE!</p>
<p>Review-2:
"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime"
